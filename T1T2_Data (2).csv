We propose a method that can be applied to hourly whole-house electrical energy data to partially disaggregate total household electricity use into five load categories/parameters (base load, activity load, heating season gradient, cooling season gradient and lowest external temperature at which air-conditioning is used). This paper develops the proposed method, and verifies it using high-resolution end-use data from twelve households with known characteristics. We then apply the method to hourly whole-house (smart meter) data from 327 households in Ontario. The roll-out of smart (advanced) metering infrastructure in many countries will make hourly whole-house data abundant, and we propose that this method could be widely applied by utilities to target their demand-side management programs towards households more likely to provide benefits, thus increasing the cost-effectiveness of such programs.

Air-conditioning (A/C) use can be determined through non-intrusive load monitoring, which separates A/C cooling energy consumption from whole-house energy data. In this paper, a disaggregation technique is described and executed on 1-min smart meter data from 88 houses in Austin, TX, USA, from July 2012 through June 2013. Nineteen houses were sub-metered to validate the accuracy of the disaggregation technique. The R2 value between the predicted and actual A/C energy use for the 19 houses was 0.90. The algorithm was then applied to all houses. On average, daily energy use from A/C increased by 25 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â± 11 kWh between a mild temperature day of 15.5 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C (60ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°F) and a hotter day of 31.5ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C (89ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°F), with an 11 kWh increase just during peak hours (14:00-20:00).

Metering of end-uses is expensive and time consuming and therefore other methods for calculation of end-use electricity can be very useful. This paper presents a method to calculate the electricity used for lighting in households based on regression analysis of daily electricity consumption, out-door temperatures and the length of daylight at the same time and location. The method is illustrated with analyses of 45 Norwegian households. The electricity use for lighting in an average Norwegian household is calculated to 1050kWh/year or 6% of total electricity use. The results are comparable to metering results of lighting in other studies in the Nordic countries. The methodology can also be used to compensate for the seasonal effect when metering electricity for lighting less than a year. When smart meters are more commonly available, the possible adaption of this method will increase, and the need for end-use demand calculations will still be present.

The database used comprises 59 predictors, for 62 observations. To address the problem of multi-collinearities among the predictors and at the same time reduce the number of needed predictors, a methodology is developed based on the latent root regression technique of Hawkins [5]. Contrary to other variable selection techniques such as the stepwise method, the technique used in this paper allows an easy identification of alternative subsets. Using this technique, a reduction of 85% in the number of predictors is obtained, leaving only nine of them in the final subset. These nine variables are the number of occupants, the house status (owned or rented), the number of weeks of vacation per year, the type of fuel used in the pool heater, the type of fuel used in the heating system, the type of fuel used in the domestic hot water heater, the existence or not of an air conditioning system, the type of air conditioning system, and the number of air changes per hour at 50 Pa. A regression with these nine predictors leads to an R2 of 0.79, with an adjusted R2 of 0.75 and all regression coefficients statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.

This paper presents a methodology which uses these data to design FITs for domestic scale grid-connected PV systems in Ireland. A sample of 2551 household electricity demand data collected at 1/2-hourly intervals, electricity output from a 2.82kWp PV system over the same time interval as well as PV system costs and electricity tariffs were used to determine the required FIT to make it worthwhile for the households to invest in the PV system. The methodology shows that it is possible to design single, multiple and continuous FITs. Continuous FITs are the most efficient and result in no overcompensation to the housholder while single and multiple FITs are less efficient since they result in different levels of overcompensation. In the PV case study considered, it was shown that the use of three FITs (0.3170, 0.3315 and 0.3475ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬/kWh) resulted in a 59.6% reduction in overcompensation compared to a single FIT of 0.3475ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬/kWh; assuming immediate and complete uptake of the technology, this would result in NPV savings of over ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬597m to the Irish government over a 25 year lifetime.

Because energy consumption fluctuates over time, the efficiency scores are stochastic random variables. Existing applications of frontier methods in energy efficiency either treat efficiency scores as deterministic values or estimate their uncertainty by resampling from one set of measurements. Availability of smart meter data (repeated measurements of energy consumption of buildings) enables using actual data to estimate the uncertainty in efficiency scores. Additionally, existing applications assume a linear form for an efficient frontier; i.e., they assume that the best-practice technology scales up and down proportionally with building characteristics. However, previous research shows that buildings are nonlinear systems. This paper proposes a statistical method called stochastic energy efficiency frontier (SEEF) to estimate a bias-corrected efficiency score and its confidence intervals from measured data. The paper proposes an algorithm to specify the functional form of the frontier, identify the probability distribution of the efficiency score of each building using measured data, and rank buildings based on their energy efficiency. To illustrate the power of SEEF, this paper presents the results from applying SEEF on a smart meter data set of 307 residential buildings in the United States. SEEF efficiency scores are used to rank individual buildings based on energy efficiency, to compare subpopulations of buildings, and to identify irregular behavior of buildings across different time-of-use periods. SEEF is an improvement to the energy-intensity method (comparing kÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â·Wh/sq.ft.): whereas SEEF identifies efficient buildings across the entire spectrum of building sizes, the energy-intensity method showed bias toward smaller buildings. The results of this research are expected to assist researchers and practitioners compare and rank (i.e., benchmark) buildings more robustly and over a wider range of building types and sizes. Eventually, doing so is expected to result in improved resource allocation in energy-efficiency programs.

We apply our method on a data set of 1628 households' electricity consumption. The results show that weather, location and floor area are among the most important determinants of residential electricity consumption. In addition to these variables, number of refrigerators and entertainment devices (e.g., VCRs) are among the most important determinants of daily minimum consumption, while number of occupants and high-consumption appliances such as electric water heaters are the most significant determinants of daily maximum consumption. Installing double-pane windows and energy-efficient lights helped to reduce consumption, as did the energy-conscious use of electric heater. Acknowledging climate change as a motivation to save energy showed correlation with lower electricity consumption. Households with individuals over 55 or between 19 and 35 years old recorded lower electricity consumption, while pet owners showed higher consumption. Contrary to some previous studies, we observed no significant correlation between electricity consumption and income level, home ownership, or building age. Some otherwise energy-efficient features such as energy-efficient appliances, programmable thermostats, and insulation were correlated with slight increase in electricity consumption.

At present, data mining and knowledge discovery in electricity meter data suffer from three notable weaknesses: 1) insufficient focus on intelligent data analysis of subgroups (subsets) whose patterns vary significantly from aggregate patterns embodied in an entire dataset; 2) a lack of effort towards generating intuitively understandable and practically applicable knowledge for industrial practitioners to identify such subgroups; and 3) limited knowledge regarding the link between unusual consumption patterns and household consumers' socio-demographic characteristics. This paper addresses these practically important but technically challenging issues by applying subgroup discovery algorithms to a real smart electricity meter dataset. Subgroups whose patterns are unusual and whose sizes are large enough are discovered, and their descriptive and predictive models are generated. Furthermore, to enrich subgroup discovery algorithms, three new-quality measures for real-valued targets are proposed. The comparative studies empirically evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of subgroup discovery on classification accuracy, predictive power, and computational resources.

Accurate forecasts of demand at the individual household-level, or of small aggregations of households, can improve the peak demand reduction brought about through such devices by helping to plan the most appropriate charging and discharging cycles. However, before such methods can be developed, validation measures which can assess the accuracy and usefulness of forecasts of the volatile and noisy household-level demand are required. In this paper we introduce a new forecast verification error measure that reduces the so-called ""double penalty"" effect, incurred by forecasts whose features are displaced in space or time, compared to traditional point-wise metrics, such as the Mean Absolute Error, and p-norms in general. The measure that we propose is based on finding a restricted permutation of the original forecast that minimises the point-wise error, according to a given metric. We illustrate the advantages of our error measure using half-hourly domestic household electrical energy usage data recorded by smart meters, and discuss the effect of the permutation restriction.

It might also be used to reinforce the electric network especially during high peak periods. However, the injection of such energy resources in the low-voltage (LV) network can leads to high voltage constrains. To overcome this issue, one can motivate customers to use thermal or electric storage devices during high-production periods of PV to foster the integration of renewable energy generation into the network.

The method is validated using a real-world case study of 4231 buildings in Ireland. Our results show that structural factors have the largest impact on energy efficiency, followed by socioeconomic factors and behavioral factors. For example, households with high penetration of efficient lightbulbs and double-glazed windows were on average 4 and 3.5% more efficient than others. Households with the head of household having higher education are on average 1.3% more efficient than their peers. Finally, households that track their energy savings are on average 0.4% more efficient than others. Furthermore, installing heater timers, wall insulation, and living in owned residences were correlated with higher efficiency. Generally, families with kids who have full-time employment and are highly-educated are more efficient compared to families with no kids, or families with retirees or unemployed members. This result has important implications for both targeting and messaging of energy efficiency programs. Some behavioral factors demonstrated significant impact on appliance energy efficiency. For instance, households that expressed interest in making major energy-saving lifestyle changes scored higher efficiency ranks on average. Conversely, households that expressed doubt about their motivation to save energy ranked lower in efficiency. This finding validates the role of educational programs to increase awareness about energy efficiency and its importance. In short, our results show that a data-driven analysis of a population is needed to develop a balanced view of the drivers of energy efficiency, and to devise a targeted approach to improve homes' energy efficiency.

There are various projections as to the rate of EV uptake, but all predict an increase over the next ten years. Charging these EVs will produce one of the biggest loads on the low voltage network. To manage the network, we must not only take into account the number of EVs taken up, but where on the network they are charging, and at what time. To simulate the impact on the network from high, medium and low EV uptake (as outlined by the UK government), we present an agent-based model. We initialise the model to assign an EV to a household based on either random distribution or social influences - that is, a neighbour of an EV owner is more likely to also purchase an EV. Additionally, we examine the effect of peak behaviour on the network when charging is at day-time, night-time, or a mix of both.

An effective solution for VSTLF can facilitate real-time electricity deployment and improve its quality. In this paper, a novel approach to model the very short-term load of individual households based on context information and daily schedule pattern analysis is proposed. Several daily behavior pattern types were obtained by analyzing the time series of daily electricity consumption, and context features from various sources were collected and used to establish a rule set for use in anticipating the likely behavior pattern type of a specific day. Meanwhile, an electricity consumption volume prediction model was developed for each behavior pattern type to predict the load at a specific time point in a day.

We apply linear regression and unsupervised classification methods to hourly, whole-home consumption and outdoor air temperature data to determine the hours, if any, that each home[U+05F3]s A/C is active, and the temperature dependence of consumption when it is active. When results from our sample are scaled up to the total population, we find a maximum of 270-360. MW (95% c.i.) of demand response potential over a 1-h duration with a 4.

The estimated resource correlates well with the evening decline of solar production on hot, summer afternoons, suggesting that demand response could potentially act as reserves for the grid during these periods in the near future with expected higher adoption rates of solar energy. Additionally, the top 5% of homes in the sample represent 40% of the total MW-hours of DR resource, suggesting that policies and programs to take advantage of this resource should target these high users to maximize cost-effectiveness.

This paper contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the EC profiles in a Southwest European city through the combination of high-resolution data from smart meters (daily electricity consumption) with door-to-door 110-question surveys for a sample of 265 households in the city of ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â°vora, in Portugal. This analysis allowed to define ten power consumption clusters using Ward's method hierarchical clustering, corresponding to four distinct types of annual consumption profiles: U shape (sharp and soft), W shape and Flat. U shape pattern is the most common one, covering 77% of the sampled households. The results show that three major groups of determinants characterize the electricity consumption segmentation: physical characteristics of a dwelling, especially year of construction and floor area; HVAC equipment and fireplaces ownership and use; and occupants' profiles (mainly number and monthly income). The combination of the daily EC data with qualitative door-to-door survey-based data proved to be a powerful data nutshell to distinguish groups of power consumers, allowing to derive insights to support DSOs, ESCOs, and retailers to design measures and instruments targeted to effective energy reduction (e.g. peak shaving, energy efficiency).

We use multiple regression models for hourly electricity consumption in Norwegian dwellings, based on panel data consisting of hourly smart meter data, weather data, and response data from a household survey. Two models based on daily and hourly mean values of outdoor temperature, respectively, are compared and discussed. Our results indicate that daily mean outdoor temperature - represented by heating degree day - can serve as weather-related input variable for modeling aggregate hourly electricity consumption. The regression models are further used to break down hourly electricity consumption into two components, representing modeled consumption for space heating and other electric appliances, respectively. Thus, without submetering electric heating equipment an estimate for heating energy consumption is available, and can be used for evaluating different demand side management options, e.g. fuel substitution or load control. Moreover, the models can be used for forecasting aggregate regional electricity consumption in the Norwegian household sector with a high temporal resolution, as e.g. changes in regional climatic conditions, dwelling structure, and demographic factors can be taken into account.

While this category of goods has expanded from household utilities, toll road access and software downloads to standard consumption goods paid by credit card or other ""bill-me-later""-type systems, we know surprisingly little about how these payment patterns affect decisions. This paper exploits hourly household electricity consumption data collected by ""smart"" electricity meters to examine dynamic consumer behavior under intermittent expenditure signals. Households reduce consumption by 0.6-1% following receipt of an electricity bill, but the response varies considerably by household type and season.

This also fostered research on grid-connected PV-battery storage systems, which are a promising technology to increase self-consumption. In this paper a mixed-integer linear optimization model of a PV-battery system that minimizes the total discounted operating and investment costs is developed. The model is employed to study the effect of the temporal resolution of electrical load and PV generation profiles on the rate of self-consumption and the optimal sizing of PV and PV-battery systems. In contrast to previous studies high resolution (10 s) measured input data for both PV generation and electrical load profiles is used for the analysis. The data was obtained by smart meter measurements in 25 different households in Germany. It is shown that the temporal resolution of load profiles is more critical for the accuracy of the determination of self-consumption rates than the resolution of the PV generation. For PV-systems without additional storage accurate results can be obtained by using 15 min solar irradiation data. The required accuracy for the electrical load profiles depends strongly on the load profile characteristics. While good results can be obtained with 60 s for all electrical load profiles, 15 min data can still be sufficient for load profiles that do not exhibit most of their electricity consumption at power levels above 2 kW. For PV-battery systems the influence of the temporal resolution on the rate of self-consumption becomes less distinct. Depending on the load profile, temporal resolutions between 5 min and 60 min yield good results. For optimal sizing of the PV power and the storage capacity a resolution of 60 min is found to be sufficient. For the sizing of the battery inverter power of the storage system, a finer temporal resolution of at least 300 s is necessary.

In an effort to reduce the impacts of this energy consumption, electricity technologies such as solar photovoltaics and smart appliances are being adopted. Evaluation of their performance requires an understanding of residential electricity use patterns. Building simulation tools can estimate the time-step performance of such technologies, but require accurate and representative ALP electricity profiles as an input. Sub-metered datasets lack in quantity and thus overall representativeness of the sector. Meanwhile, large, representative datasets are becoming available through electricity smart-metering programs, but usually consist only of whole-house electricity load and lack summary household characteristics (e.g. occupancy, floor space, appliance descriptions). However, homes which are not electrically heated (space, water) or cooled may function as ALP load profiles for simulation. This research addresses these loads with a new method of distinguishing non-electrically heated and cooled homes from a broad dataset of whole-house profiles. The method originates from a comparison of two electricity load datasets: (i) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“smart-meterÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 15-min time-step whole-house data for 160 homes spanning three years, and (ii) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“sub-meteredÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 1-min time-step data for 23 residential homes.

In hotter climates, such as Texas, air-conditioning (AC) systems are important contributors to overall residential electricity demand. Providing a quick, simple and effective framework to describe and compare electricity demand patterns between different houses is valuable to identify potential candidates for peak load reduction and overall energy use mitigation. In this study, we evaluate the application of daily change-point models to describe the demand patterns of residential AC systems for 45 actual houses in Austin, TX during 2013. While previous research regarding change-point models has been focused on monthly data for commercial buildings, this study extends its application to daily residential energy use.

We evaluate our approach by analyzing smart meter data collected from 4232 households in Ireland at a 30-mingranularity over a period of 1.5 years. Our analysis shows that revealing characteristics from smart meter data is feasible, as our method achieves an accuracy of more than 70% over all households for many of the characteristics and even exceeds 80% for some of the characteristics. The findings are applicable to all smart metering systems without making changes to the measurement infrastructure.

The improved consumption feedback provided, and in particular, the installation of in-house displays, has been shown to significantly reduce residential electricity demand in some international trials. This paper attempts to uncover the underlying drivers of such information-led reductions by exploring two research questions. First, does feedback improve a household's stock of information about potential energy reducing behaviours? And second, do improvements in such information help explain the demand reductions associated with the introduction of smart metering and time-of-use tariffs? Data is from a randomised controlled smart metering trial (Ireland) which also collected extensive information on household attitudes towards energy conservation and self-reported stocks of information related to energy saving. As with previous results in Ireland, we find that participation in a smart metering programme with time-of-use tariffs significantly reduces demand. Although treated households also increased their self-reported energy-reducing information, such improvements are not correlated with demand reductions in the short-run. Given this result, it is possible that feedback and other information provided in the context of smart metering are mainly effective in reducing and shifting demand because they act as a reminder and motivator.

Tariff incentives and direct load control of residential air-conditioners and electric heaters are flexible solutions to reduce the peak demand. To include residential demand response resources in planning operators, quantifying the demand reduction is becoming a major issue for all electrical stakeholders. Current methods are based on day or weather matching, regressions and control group approaches. In general, methods using available data from a control group give more accurate results. With the introduction of smart meters, the electric utilities generate a large amount of quality data, available almost in real time. In this paper, we suggest using these available residential load curves to select a control group based on individual load curves. One of the advantages of our method is that the selected control group could adapt at anytime to the number of individuals belonging to the demand reduction program, as this number evolves with customers entering and leaving the program.

Specifically, a new concept of finding the demand states using energy consumption of consumers over time and feasible transitions therein is introduced. It is shown that the orchestration of temporal transitions between the demand states can meet broad range of smart grid objectives. An online demand regulation model is developed that captures the temporal dynamics of energy demand to identify target consumers for different DR programs.

But increasing numbers of studies show major differences between the results of these simulations and the actual measured performance of the buildings they are intended to model. The accuracy and calibration of building simulations have been studied extensively in the commercial sector, but these new applications have created a need to better understand the performance of home energy simulations. In this paper, we assess the ability of the DOE's EnergyPlus software to simulate the energy consumption of 106 homes using audit records, homeowner survey records, and occupancy estimates taken from monitored data. We compare the results of these simulations to device-level monitored data from the actual homes to provide a first measure of the accuracy of the EnergyPlus condensing unit, central air supply fan, and other energy consumption model estimates in a large number of homes. We then conduct sensitivity analysis to observe which physical and behavioral characteristics of the homes and homeowners most influence the accuracy of the modeling. Results show that EnergyPlus models do not accurately or consistently estimate occupied whole-home energy consumption. While some models accurately predict annual energy consumption to within 1% of measured data, none of the modeled homes meet ASHRAE criteria for a calibrated model when looking at hourly interval data. The majority of this error is due to appliance and lighting energy overestimates, followed by AC condensing unit use. These inaccuracies are due to factors such as occupant behaviors and differences in appliance and lighting stocks which are not well-captured in traditional energy audit reports. We identify a number of factors which must be specified for an accurate model, and others where using a default value will produce a similar result. The use of building simulation tools reflects a shift from a component-focused approach to a systems approach to residential code analysis and compliance verification that will serve to better identify and deploy efficiency measures in homes. By better understanding the limitations of home energy simulations and adopting strategies to mitigate the effects of model errors, simulation models can serve as valuable decision making tools in the residential sector.

Accordingly, more advanced applications, such as electricity market design, integration of distributed generation and theft detection can be developed. By employing data mining techniques on smart meter recordings, the suppliers can efficiently investigate the load patterns of consumers. This paper presents applications where data mining of energy usage can derive useful information. Higher demands, on one side, and the energy price increase on the other side, have caused serious issues with regards to electricity theft, especially among developing countries. This phenomenon leads to considerable operational losses within the electrical network. In order to identify illegal residential consumers, a new method of analysing and identifying electricity consumption patterns of consumers is proposed in this paper.

The influence of the environment air temperature (multiple maximum and minimum daily thresholds) on electricity consumption was explored for a final sample of 19 households located in southwestern Europe (characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters), taking the full year of 2014. Statistical analysis of the deviations from hourly average electricity consumptions for each temperature thresholds was performed for each household. Firstly, these deviations could act as proxies highlighting possible lack of thermal comfort on space cooling, and partially on space heating, supported by door-to-door survey data, on socio-economic details of occupants, buildings bearing structure and equipment's ownership and use. Secondly, meaningful differences of consumersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ behavior on electricity consumption pattern were identified as a response for space heating and cooling to the environment air temperatures thresholds. Additionally, statistical clusters of active and non-active behavior groups of households were assessed, showing the electricity use for space heating. This paper illustrates the importance of the widespread use of smart-meters data on the increasingly electrified buildings sector, to understand whether and how thermal comfort could be achieved through active climatization behavior of its occupants. This is particularly important in regions where automatic HVAC systems are almost absent.

Key characteristic information to the data is often lost, particularly when averaging or aggregation processes are applied. Therefore, other methods of analysing data need to be used so that this information is not lost. One such method which lends itself to analysing large amounts of information is data mining. This allows for the data to be segmented before such aggregation processes are applied. Moreover, segmentation allows for dimension reduction thus enabling easier manipulation of the data.Clustering methods have been used in the electricity industry for some time. However, their use at a domestic level has been somewhat limited to date. This paper investigates three of the most widely used unsupervised clustering methods: k-means, k-medoid and Self Organising Maps (SOM). The best performing technique is then evaluated in order to segment individual households into clusters based on their pattern of electricity use across the day. The process is repeated for each day over a six month period in order to characterise the diurnal, intra-daily and seasonal variations of domestic electricity demand. Based on these results a series of Profile Classes (PC's) are presented that represent common patterns of electricity use within the home. Finally, each PC is linked to household characteristics by applying a multi-nominal logistic regression to the data. As a result, households and the manner with which they use electricity in the home can be characterised based on individual customer attributes.

With the widespread integration of smart meters, consumers can leverage the high temporal resolution of energy consumption data to optimize a PV system based on their individual circumstances. In this article, such an optimization strategy is developed to enable the optimal selection of size, tilt, azimuth and retail electricity plan for a residential PV system based on hourly consumption data. Hourly solar insolation and PV array generation models are presented as the principal components of the underlying objective function. A net present value analysis of the potential monetary savings is considered and set as the optimization objective. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized, modified to include a penalty function in order to handle associated constraints. The optimization problem is applied to real-world Australian consumption data to establish the economic performance and characteristics of the optimized systems. For all customers assessed, an optimized PV system producing a positive economic benefit could be found. However not all investment options were found to be desirable with at most 77.5% of customers yielding an acceptable rate of return. For the customers assessed, the mean PV system size was found to be 2 kW less than the mean size of actual systems installed in the assessed locations during 2015 and 2016. Over-sizing of systems was found to significantly reduce the potential net benefit of residential PV from an investor's perspective. The results presented in this article highlight the necessity for economic performance optimization to be routinely implemented for small-scale residential PV under current regulatory and future smart grid operating environments.

Compared with traditional electricity data based on aggregated consumption, smart meter data are much more volatile and less predictable. There is a need within the energy industry for probabilistic forecasts of household electricity consumption to quantify the uncertainty of future electricity demand in order to undertake appropriate planning of generation and distribution. We propose to estimate an additive quantile regression model for a set of quantiles of the future distribution using a boosting procedure. By doing so, we can benefit from flexible and interpretable models, which include an automatic variable selection. We compare our approach with three benchmark methods on both aggregated and disaggregated scales using a smart meter data set collected from 3639 households in Ireland at 30-min intervals over a period of 1.5 years. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach based on quantile regression provides better forecast accuracy for disaggregated demand, while the traditional approach based on a normality assumption (possibly after an appropriate Box-Cox transformation) is a better approximation for aggregated demand. These results are particularly useful since more energy data will become available at the disaggregated level in the future.

Daily electricity smart metersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ registries were combined with socio-economic data, collected from door-to-door surveys, to understand the extent and the determinants of energy consumption for two contrasting consumer groups (herein called fuel poverty and fuel obesity groups). The analysis is based on the amount and annual profile of electricity consumption and was complemented with building energy simulations for relevant building typologies in those groups, to identify heating and cooling thermal performance gaps. The existence of these gaps allowed confirming and/or discarding the initial hypothesis of the poverty or obesity conditions. Results disclose socio-economic variables, as income, and consumersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ behavior as key determinants of electricity consumption. It was identified a severe lack of thermal comfort levels inside households of both groups, either in cooling (98% for fuel poverty and 87% for fuel obesity) and heating seasons (98% for fuel poverty and 94% for fuel obesity). Major conclusion refers that electricity consumption cannot be used alone to segment consumer groups.

We implement iProgram as a web service and show that it reduces the mismatch time between the occupancy pattern and the thermostat schedule by a median value of 44.28min (out of 100 homes) when compared to a default 8am-6pm weekday schedule, with a median deviation of 30.76min off the optimal schedule. Further, iProgram yields a daily energy savings of 0.42kWh on average across the 100 homes. Moreover, the schedules generated from iProgram converge to optimal schedules within a couple of weeks for most homes. We also show that homeowners having multiple HVAC zones can utilize iProgram and potentially increase unconditioned times of less occupied parts of their homes by 70%.

While some past studies have quantified sensitivities of electricity use to ambient temperature, 1) few previous studies utilize both high temporal and spatial resolution electricity data, and 2) no research to our knowledge has investigated how the temporal and spatial resolution of electricity data, and choice of ambient temperature indicators, affects quantification of these sensitivities.

The use of historical load profiles with daily and weekly seasonality, combined with weather data, leaves the explicit calendar effects a very low predictive power.

The profitability of PV self-consumption system largely depends on the match of PV output and the householdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s electricity consumption. In energy system modelling, the householdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s consumption behaviour is represented by means of a standard load profile. However, the household sectorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s heterogeneity is not reflected in one single profile, and the use of only one load profile results in a misjudgement of the profitability of self-consumption. In this study, we present a set of representative household groups that better represent the heterogeneous residential consumption behaviour. The household groups were compiled through the cluster analysis of smart-meter data based on hourly electricity consumption, using household characteristics as explanatory variables. Between the average load profiles of the groups, significant differences were found. Subsequently to the clustering, self-consumption based on a combined PV and battery system was simulated for each household. We found that the achievable level of self-consumption also differs between the groups, which in turn affect the profitability of the PV and battery systems. A statistical analysis revealed that employment and the presence of children are distinguishing factors for the different types of self-consumers. These results suggest that (i) the residential sector is not well represented by a single standard load profile, particularly so in the context of self-consumption modelling. (ii) Different self-consumer types can be identified through socio-demographic characteristics: We found that unemployed households achieve the highest self-sufficiency rates with an average of 40%, the lowest rates with 30% on average occur within households of educated families. (iii) Although the discrepancies are significant, the effect of these differences on profitability is still limited under the current market conditions.

We find that the average participating household reduces consumption by 5%, which provides private savings in the form of lower electricity bills and social cost savings by decreasing generation and pollution costs. The private savings exceed the social savings by an average of 140%, so the average household is faced with an incentive to overinvest in energy efficiency.

Such load curves describe electricity demand over a period of time. A rich body of the literature has studied clustering of load curves, usually using temporal features. This limits the potential to discover new knowledge, which may not be best represented as models consisting of all time points on load curves. This paper presents three new methods to construct features: 1) conditional filters on time-resolution-based features; 2) calibration and normalization; and 3) using profile errors. These new features extend the potential of clustering load curves. Moreover, smart metering is now generating high-resolution time series, and so the dimensionality reduction offered by these features is welcome. The clustering results using the proposed new features are compared with clusterings obtained from temporal features, as well as clusterings with Fourier features, using household electricity consumption time series as test data. The experimental results suggest that the proposed feature construction methods offer new means for gaining insight in energy-consumption patterns.

For example, in the UK they have been estimated as being 4% of the energy supplied by low-voltage networks. However, the breakdown of the losses to individual conductors and their split over time are poorly understood as generally only the peak demands and average loads over several months have been recorded. The introduction of domestic smart meters has the potential to change this. How domestic smart meter readings can be used to estimate the actual losses is analysed. In particular, the accuracy of using 30 min readings compared with 1 min readings, and how this accuracy could be improved, were investigated. This was achieved by assigning the data recorded by 100 smart meters with a time resolution of 1 min to three test networks. Smart meter data from three sources were used in the investigation. It was found that 30 min resolution data underestimated the losses by between 9 and 24%. By fitting an appropriate model to the data, it was possible to reduce the inaccuracy by 50%. Having a smart meter time resolution of 10 min rather than 30 gave little improvement to the accuracy.

It is anticipated that such informed consumers in control of their consumption patterns will contribute to reduced energy usage and thus a sustainable environment. Smart meter technology in smart homes provides real-time information to customers through devices such as in-home displays and web portals, and provide half-hourly consumption data to electricity distributors and retailers. Such data enables the profiling of consumers making it possible to understand different life styles and electricity usage behaviours to provide customised electricity billing. To obtain the anticipated benefit from such highly granular and high frequency data, it is essential to have big data technologies which can process such volumes of data in near real time. The research described in this paper focus on addressing the key requirements of large volume data processing and making use of the highly granular nature of the data. Adapting a new scalable algorithm introduced by the authors for big data processing, this work demonstrates the practicality of processing large volumes of data at multiple levels of granularity. The faster processing capacity makes it possible to continuously analyse consumption data at frequent intervals as they are collected and at a highly granular level thus providing a practical solution as a smart home application. The advantages of the technique is demonstrated using electricity consumption data for 10,000 households for a year from an Australian electricity retailer.

In this paper, I evaluate how low-income households in a major Colombian city respond to this policy. Using hourly household electricity consumption data, I find that, on average, households reduce electricity consumption by 4.5% as a result of the policy. It is striking that even low-income households, who consume relatively small amounts of electricity, respond to energy-saving policies and engage in conservation behaviors in the short term. In my analysis, I also find that the effect is stronger the higher the household pre-treatment electricity consumption levels and smaller among poorer households. However, the heterogeneity in terms of income level vanishes once I control for household pre-program electricity consumption levels. Finally, my point estimates are comparable to the impact estimates of policies that are similar to the one I analyze in this paper.

However, recent findings from European smart metering trials have reduced the optimism, suggesting only modest savings from energy feedback. In this paper, we investigate the potential of HEMS to foster reductions in energy use, focusing on a population segment of particular relevance; high-income and highly educated households, considered as early adopters of smart grid technologies. Covering 154 households participating in a field trial in a sustainable city district in Stockholm, Sweden during one year, this study draws on the analyses of smart meter electricity and hot tap water data and in-depth interviews to provide an increased understanding of how feedback and features are perceived, used, and acted upon, and resulting effects on awareness, behavior, and consumption. Our results show that impact on energy consumption varies widely across individual households, suggesting that households respond to energy feedback highly individually. Although HEMS may lead to increased awareness of energy consumption, as well as increased home comfort, several obstacles for energy consumption behavioral change are identified. Drawing from these findings, we suggest policy implications and key issues for future research.

Information on load composition is highly beneficial for different demand side management applications. In order to decompose total forecasted load of aggregated households where only some are monitored by smart meters (SMs) with submetering capabilities, a two-level methodology is proposed. At the first level, load disaggregation of the load monitored by SMs is done based on measurements of power consumed by each home appliance, and at the second, the disaggregation of the total forecasted load is performed using artificial neural network. This paper investigates the required percentage of users in an aggregation that should be equipped with a SM with submetering capabilities in order to forecast (within certain confidence level) the load composition of the overall aggregated demand. The methodology was first tested on a UK statistics-based load model, and then validated on a real pilot site's consumption dataset. The results show that even with 5% SM coverage, one can forecast, with high confidence, the composition of the load at the substation (aggregation point). In other words, there is no techno-economic justification for submetering technologies to be installed at every user's premise; a limited installation of such devices would suffice.

This paper presents a clustering-based knowledge discovery in databases method to analyze residential heating consumption data and evaluate information included in national building databases. The proposed method uses the K-means algorithm to segment consumption groups based on consumption intensity and representative patterns and ranks the groups according to daily consumption. This paper also examines the correlation between energy intensity and the characteristics of buildings and occupants, load profiles of households, consumption behavior changes over time, and consumption variability. The results show that the majority of the customers can be represented by fairly constant load profiles. Calendar context has an impact not only on the patterns but also on the consumption intensity and user behaviors. The variability studies show that consumption patterns are serially correlated, the customers with high energy consumption have lower variability, and the consumption is more stable over time.

The electricity load from consumers is simply aggregated or optimally clustered to more predictable groups by cluster analysis. The clustering approach consists of efficient preprocessing of data obtained from smart meters by a model-based representation and the K-means method. We have implemented two types of unsupervised ensemble learning methods to investigate the performance of forecasting on clustered or simply aggregated load: bootstrap aggregating based and the newly proposed density-clustering based. Three new bootstrapping methods for time series analysis methods were newly proposed in order to handle the noisy behaviour of time series. The smart meter datasets used in our experiments come from Australia, London, and Ireland, where data from residential consumers were available. The achieved results suggest that for extremely fluctuating and noisy time series the forecasting accuracy improvement through the bagging can be a challenging task. However, our experimental evaluation shows that in most of the cases the density-based unsupervised ensemble learning methods are significantly improving forecasting accuracy of aggregated or clustered electricity load.

Then, a set of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are designed and implemented to determine the load profiles and forecast the electricity consumption for residential buildings for the next 24 hours. For the Short-Term Load Forecast (STLF), a Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Network (FF-ANN) algorithm with backtracking adjustment of the learning rate that extends and optimizes the Nesterov learning method is proposed. Its performance is compared with six algorithms, i.e. FF-ANN with well-known learning methods, namely Momentum and Nesterov, Non-linear AutoRegressive with eXogenous (NARX), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB) and Random Forests (RF) that are competitive and powerful ML algorithms which have been successfully used for load forecast. Hence, for STLF, the seven algorithms are executed simultaneously and the best one is automatically selected considering its accuracy in terms of Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE). The proposed methodology contains the steps required to implement the Big Data framework, i.e. data pre-processing, transformation and loading, the configuration of the ML algorithms for dimensionality reduction, clustering, STLF with different algorithms from which the Best Performant Algorithm (BPA) is automatically selected to provide STLF for the next 24 hours.

Other than aggregated residential load in a large scale, forecasting an electric load of a single energy user is fairly challenging due to the high volatility and uncertainty involved. In this paper, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network-based framework, which is the latest and one of the most popular techniques of deep learning, to tackle this tricky issue. The proposed framework is tested on a publicly available set of real residential smart meter data, of which the performance is comprehensively compared to various benchmarks including the state-of-the-arts in the field of load forecasting.

This growth will provide challenges for a diversity of stakeholders, from grid operators charged with maintaining a reliable and cost-effective power system, to low-income communities that may struggle to afford increased electricity costs. Despite the importance of building a quantitative understanding of trends in existing and future AC usage, methods to estimate AC penetration with high spatial and temporal resolution are lacking. In this study we develop a new classification method to characterize AC penetration patterns with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution (i.e. at the census tract level), using the Greater Los Angeles Area as a case study. The method utilizes smart meter data records from 180 476 households over two years, along with local ambient temperature records. When spatially aggregated, the overall AC penetration rate of the Greater Los Angeles Area is 69%, which is similar to values reported by previous studies.

With the privilege of smart meters in smart cities, this paper proposes a data-driven probabilistic peak demand estimation framework using fine-grained smart meter data and sociodemographic data of the consumers, which drive fundamental electricity consumptions across different categories. In particular, four main stages are integrated in the proposed approach: load modeling and sampling via the proposed variable truncated R-vine copulas method, correlation-based customer grouping, probabilistic normalized maximum diversified demand estimation, and probabilistic peak demand estimation for new customers. Numerical experiments have been conducted on real demand measurements across 2639 households in London, collected from Low Carbon London project's smart-metering trial.

However, the dynamic behavior of the occupants introduces uncertainty problems that affect the performance of the BEMS. To address this uncertainty problem, the BEMS may implement load forecasting as one of the BEMS modules. Load forecasting utilizes historical load data to compute model predictions for a specific time in the future. Recently, smart meters have been introduced to collect electricity consumption data. Smart meters not only capture aggregation data, but also individual data that is more frequently close to real-time. The processing of both smart meter data types for load forecasting can enhance the performance of the BEMS when confronted with uncertainty problems. The collection of smart meter data can be processed using a batch approach for short-term load forecasting, while the real-time smart meter data can be processed for very short-term load forecasting, which adjusts the short-term load forecasting to adapt to the dynamic behavior of the occupants. This approach requires different data processing techniques for aggregation and individual of smart meter data. In this paper, we propose Lambda-based data processing architecture to process the different types of smart meter data and implement the two-level load forecasting approach, which combines short-term and very short-term load forecasting techniques on top of our proposed data processing architecture. The proposed approach is expected to enhance the BEMS to address the uncertainty problem in order to process data in less time. Our experiment showed that the proposed approaches improved the accuracy by 7% compared to a typical BEMS with only one load forecasting technique, and had the lowest computation time when processing the smart meter data.

Challenging hegemonic framings of mitigation solutions and scalability,"Urban energy transitions are key components of urgently requisite climate change mitigation. Promissory discourse accords smart grids pride of place within them. We employ a living lab to study smart grids as a solution geared towards upscaling and systematisation, investigate their limits as a climate change mitigation solution, and assess them rigorously as urban energy transitions. Our 18 month living lab simulates a household energy management platform in Bergen. Norway's mitigation focus promotes smart meter roll-out as reducing carbon emissions, by (i) unlocking efficiency gains, and (ii) increasing awareness for demand-side management. We problematise this discourse. Raising awareness encounters intractable challenges for smart grid scalability. Scattered efficiency gains constitute modest increments rather than the substantial change requisite for rapid mitigation. Whereas promissory smart grid discourse overlooks these ground-truthed limits, our findings caution against misplaced expectations concerning mitigation. We contest discursive enthusiasm on smart grids and argue for aligning local and systemic concerns before upscaling to avoid obscuring risks. Scaling up requires understanding and addressing interdependencies and trade-offs across scales. Focus group discussions and surveys with living lab participants who used sub-meter monitors to track real-time household electricity consumption data over an extended period show that technical issues and energy behaviour, as well as political economic and policy structures and factors, pose significant limits to smart grids. Urban strategies for climate change mitigation must be informed by this recognition. Our results indicate that upscaling relies on bottom-up popular acceptance of the salient technical, organisational and standardisation measures, but that measures to improve the democratic legitimacy of and participation in energy transitions remain weak. We highlight limits to smart grids as a standalone urban mitigation solution and call for a sharper focus on accompanying thrust areas for systematisation and scalability, such as renewable energy integration and grid coordination.

Clustering has a number of potential advantages for DNOs, including the identification of suitable candidates for demand response and the improvement of energy profile modeling. However, due to the high stochasticity and irregularity of household-level demand, detailed analytics are required to define appropriate attributes to cluster. In this paper, we present in-depth analysis of customer smart meter data to better understand the peak demand and major sources of variability in their behavior. We find four key time periods, in which the data should be analyzed, and use this to form relevant attributes for our clustering. We present a finite mixture modelbased clustering, where we discover ten distinct behavior groups describing customers based on their demand and their variability. Finally, using an existing bootstrap technique, we show that the clustering is reliable. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time in the power systems literature that the sample robustness of the clustering has been tested.

Battery size is one of the most important factors that impact the financial return since it determines the major operational capabilities of the solar-coupled storage system. To select the optimal battery size for a photovoltaic solar customer, it is important to perform an analysis taking account of the customer's on-site generation and consumption characteristics. However, in most cases there are insufficient pre-existing data of the required quality making it difficult to perform such analysis. In this paper, we propose a model that can achieve satisfactory battery sizing results with a limited amount of net meter electricity data. The model uses K-means clustering on customer net meter electricity data to discover important information to extrapolate limited input net/gross meter energy data and uses this in a techno-economic simulation model to determine the optimal battery size. The approach is validated using a set of 262 solar households, two tariff structures (flat and Time-of-Use)and a naive forecasting method as a comparison to the proposed model. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the alternative baseline model and can work with as little as one month of net meter energy data for both of the evaluated tariff structures. On average, the model results in 0.10 normalised root mean squared error in yearly battery savings and net present values, 0.07 normalised root mean squared error in annual electricity costs and a r-squared value of 0.717 in finding the optimal size of batteries. Moreover, this study reveals a linear correlation between the used clustering validity index (Davies-Bouldin Index), and errors in estimated annual battery savings which indicates that this index can be used as a metric for the developed battery sizing approach. With the ongoing rollouts of net meters, the proposed model can address the data shortage issue for both gross and net meter households and assist end users, installers and utilities with their battery sizing analysis.

Consequently, housing stock models are sensitive to assumptions made on heating temperatures. This study proposes a heat balance approach, inspired by the classical degree-day method, applied to an extensive urban dataset. The goal of this analysis is to determine heterogeneous characteristics, such as temperature setpoints of heating systems and thermal envelope characteristics from an overall population of residential buildings. Measured energy data are utilized for the purpose of the study from the city of Aarhus, Denmark, where the energy usage for heating of circa 14,000 households was monitored over time via smart meters. These data are combined with actual weather data as well as data extracted by a national building database. Using linear regression and heat balance models, temperature setpoints for the whole dataset are determined with a median and average of 19 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C and 19.1 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C, respectively. Furthermore, building related characteristics such as thermal and ventilation losses per building and overall heat transfer coefficients are extracted at urban scale. The reliability of the method over its complexity is discussed with regards to the big sample that has been applied to. In general, the overall performance of the approach is satisfactory achieving a coefficient of determination with an average of 0.8, and is found to be in line with previous findings, considering also the high uncertainty associated with building-related input parameters.

In the past, household energy behavior was typically unknown because conventional meters only recorded the total amount of energy consumed for a household over a significant period of time. The rollout of smart meters enabled real-time household energy consumption to be recorded and analyzed. This paper uses smart meter readings from more than 5000 Irish households to identify energy behavior indicators through a cross-domain feature selection and coding approach. The idea is to extract and connect customers' features from energy domain and demography domain, i.e., smart metering data and household information. Smart metering data are characterized by typical energy spectral patterns, whereas household information is encoded as the energy behavior indicator. The results show that employment status and internet usage are highly correlated with household energy behavior in Ireland because employment status and internet usage have an important effect on lifestyle, including when to work, play, and rest, and hence yield a difference in electricity use style. The proposed approach offers a simple, transparent and effective alternative to a challenging cross-domain matching problem with massive smart metering data and energy behavior indicators.

However, the rapid integration of distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation presents great challenges in obtaining reliable and secure grid operations because of its limited visibility and intermittent nature. Under this reality, net load forecasting is facing unprecedented difficulty in answering the following question: How can we accurately predict the net load while capturing the massive uncertainties arising from distributed PV generation and load, especially in the context of high PV penetration? This paper proposes a novel probabilistic day-ahead net load forecasting method to capture both epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty using Bayesian deep learning, which is a new field that combines Bayesian probability theory and deep learning. The proposed methodological framework employs clustering in subprofiles and considers residential rooftop PV outputs as input features to enhance the performance of aggregated net load forecasting. Numerical experiments have been carried out based on fine-grained smart meter data from the Australian grid with separately recorded measurements of rooftop PV generation and loads. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared with a series of state-of-the-art methods and indicate the importance and effectiveness of subprofile clustering and high PV visibility.

To this end, a good understanding of customer load profiling for both the electricity and gas is fundamental to improve the energy utilization efficiency. Unfortunately, the hourly based energy load profiles are not directly available with the energy suppliers due to cost constraints. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to build gas load profiles using the gas network flow data for the residential sector in Singapore. In addition, we conduct a comparative study between the household gas and electricity load profiles. The gas flow data is generated from a real experimental setup, directly connected to the gas distribution network of Singapore, while the electricity load data is generated from the smart meters installed at the housing units at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. It is experimentally shown and also validated from EMA statistics that the daily gas consumption is approximately four times lower than the daily electricity consumption. Moreover, the differentiation between the weekdays and weekend for both the electricity and gas usage profiles is also presented. This work can serve as a benchmark study for designing the low-cost prediction models for gas and electricity consumption in Singapore for effective planning of both the gas and electricity networks.

It is known that household characteristics, behaviours and routines drive a number of features of household electricity loads in ways which are currently not fully understood. The roll out of domestic smart meters in the UK and elsewhere could enable better understanding through the collection of high temporal resolution electricity monitoring data at the household level. Such data affords tremendous potential to invert the established relationship between household characteristics and temporal load profiles. Rather than use household characteristics as a predictor of loads, observed electricity load profiles, or indicators based on them, could instead be used to impute household characteristics. These micro level imputed characteristics could then be aggregated at the small area level to produce ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œcensus-likeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ small area indicators.

It then presents descriptive analysis of a large scale smart meter-like dataset of half-hourly domestic electricity consumption before reviewing the correlation between household attributes and electricity load profiles. The paper then reports the results of multilevel model-based analysis of these relationships. The work concludes that a number of household characteristics of the kind to be found in UK census-derived small area statistics may be predicted from particular load profile indicators.

In the UK, several interventions have been implemented to achieve these objectives. This paper investigates one such policy lever - the Energy Price Cap - to understand if it has been designed and implemented efficiently and equitably. The price cap was introduced for customers on prepayment meters to combat increased levels of fuel poverty and a lack of competition in this group. However, the price cap was based on several assumptions of how energy is used. In this work, we assess how well the price cap accounts for real energy use using smart meter data. Households on economy 7 (EC7) tariffs were found to spend more than those on standard rate tariffs, as EC7 customers use more electricity during peak hours than assumed in government calculations. Additionally, many of the EC7 customers in this sample still use a considerable amount of gas, suggesting the EC7 heating product is either not sufficient, or is not being utilised in a cost-effective manner. Revisions to the input assumptions in government models for EC7 customers would therefore be beneficial in future price cap levels.

Smart meters that are capable of providing detailed information on buildings energy consumption, open several doors of opportunity to short-term load forecasting at the individual building level. In the current paper, four machine learning methods have been employed to forecast the daily peak and hourly energy consumption of domestic buildings. The utilized models depend merely on buildings historical energy consumption and are evaluated on the profiles that were not previously trained on. It is evident that developing data-driven models lacking external information such as weather and building data are of great importance under the situations that the access to such information is limited or the computational procedures are costly. Moreover, the performance evaluation of the models on separated house profiles determines their generalization ability for unseen consumption profiles. The conducted experiments on the smart meter data of several UK houses demonstrated that if the models are fed with sufficient historical data, they can be generalized to a satisfactory level and produce quite accurate results even if they only use past consumption values as the predictor variables. Furthermore, among the four applied models, the ones based on deep learning and ensemble techniques, display better performance in predicting daily peak load consumption than those of others.

This paper presents a pilot program of energy feedback reports based on analytical methods to show the relationship between electricity consumption and household lifestyle in Japan. One type of report was for households with a night-oriented lifestyle, which were classified by means of frequency analysis; it was evident that such households should shift to a healthy, environmentally friendly, morning-oriented lifestyle. Another type of report was based on cluster analysis: it pinpointed the dates and times when the household consumed much more electricity than with its regular routine. Through panel data regression analysis, it was found that the reports contributed to reducing daily household electricity consumption-as long as a boomerang effect could be avoided. It was also found that the feedback effect was enhanced by activation of consciousness, norms, and motives.

AMI data can have greater impacts in various fields that employ building energy analysis such as energy use prediction, fault detection, model calibration, and short-term monitoring because the AMI data is more meaningful due to granularity. However, this is not always true if we do not properly use the AMI data. In this paper, we evaluated how interval energy use data is useful for the prediction and short-term monitoring for residential buildings. Two phases were applied to multi-residential buildings in a case study apartment in South Korea. Phase I compares the change-point linear regression models between daily, weekly, and monthly interval energy use data. Phase II determines the minimum data period required to determine each coefficient of change-point linear regression models using an advanced analysis method compared to a previous Dry-Bulb Temperature Analysis (DBTA) study. The results from Phase I showed that weekly interval data could be the best option to analyze residential energy use. Phase II demonstrated that the new analysis method, called the coefficient checking method, is useful to find short-term energy monitoring periods for the data logger installation in terms of weather-independent and weather-dependent electricity use as well as the prediction of the whole-building energy use.

The commonly employed approaches for disaggregating the share of the AC load from the total consumption are either using data obtained from dedicated sensors or high-frequency data that cannot be provided by conventional smart meters. In the present work, an alternative approach is proposed, in which a machine learning-based pipeline is first optimised and trained using the data obtained from a set of households in a period, including both smart meter data and the AC load measurements along with corresponding weather conditions. The obtained optimal pipeline is then utilised to estimate the AC load in another set of buildings in the same period of the year, while providing it with only the smart meter data and weather conditions. As the first step of the pipeline implementation, several features are extracted from the smart meters and weather data. The most promising algorithm is then determined, the corresponding hyper-parameters are optimised and the most influential parameters are finally determined. The proposed method leads to a lower monitoring system's cost, lower user privacy concerns and fewer data processing complexity compared to the conventional energy disaggregation approaches, while providing an acceptable accuracy.

The extensive deployment of DR trials and the roll-out of smart meters enable the quantification of consumer responsiveness to price signals via baseline estimation. The traditional deterministic baseline estimation approach can provide only a single value without consideration of uncertainty. This paper proposes a novel probabilistic baseline estimation framework that consists of a daily load profile pool construction stage, a deep learning-based clustering stage, an optimal cluster selection stage, and a quantile regression forests model construction stage. In particular, the concept of a daily load profile pool is introduced, and a deep-learning-based clustering approach is employed to handle a large number of daily patterns to further improve the baseline estimation performance. Case studies have been conducted on fine-grained smart meter data collected from a real dynamic time-of-use tariffs trial of the low carbon London project. The superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated based on a series of evaluation metrics regarding both deterministic and probabilistic estimation results.

While most of the existing literature has focused on load forecasting, this paper, for the first time, contributes to this transition at both single household and low aggregate levels through a comprehensive study. The paper also proposes a multi-input single-output (MISO) model based on an efficient long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, by which different household energy profiles help provide more accurate forecasts for other households or aggregate energy profile. This technique, indeed, considers the spatial dependencies of households' profile indirectly. Through this study, the underlying problem of short-term net energy forecasting is compared to load forecasting, and it is shown how the inclusion of PV generation behind the meter could deteriorate forecasting accuracy. Moreover, the impact of the level of granularity associated with smart meter data on the aggregated net energy forecasting is discussed, and it is revealed that the higher resolution data can potentially alleviate the accuracy lost. Furthermore, online LSTM, as opposed to proposed batch learning MISO LSTM, is used as a forecasting tool. The results show online LSTM is more resilient to sudden changes at the single household level, while MISO LSTM is efficient for aggregate level. The proposed framework is conducted on two real Ausgrid and Solar Analytics case studies in Australia.

The analysis inspects measured energy data of 217 households from three smart grid pilot projects in the Netherlands and a public dataset with smart meter data from 70 households as a reference. The datasets were evaluated for one year and compared to provide insights on technologies and other differences based on seven key performance indicators, giving a comprehensive overview: monthly electricity consumption (100-600 kWh) and production (4-200 kWh); annually imported (3.1-4.5 MWh) and exported (0.2-1 MWh) electricity; residual load; peak of imported (4.8-6.8 kW) and exported (0.3-2.2 kW) electricity; import simultaneity (20-70.5%); feed in simultaneity (75-89%); self-sufficiency (18-20%); and self-consumption (50-70%). It was found that the electrification of heating systems in buildings by using heat pumps leads to an increase of annual electricity consumption and peak loads of approximately 30% compared to the average Dutch households without heat pumps. Moreover, these peaks have a high degree of simultaneity. To increase both the self-sufficiency and self-consumption of households, further investigations will be required to optimize smart grid systems.

The DOR is complementary to the method used to generate the asset rating of UK dwellings: the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP). The DOR is transparent, easy to calculate, based on readily available information, producible from daily smart meter data, calculable for any period on a rolling year basis and applicable across all UK homes. The DOR method was developed using a new primary data set collected from 114 homes as part of the DEFACTO project. All were semi-detached, gas centrally heated, privately owned and internet connected properties, located in the English Midlands. The mean daily energy demands are analysed alongside information gathered through an energy survey and household questionnaires. These data are presented and analysed for the first time in this paper.

This information presents a valuable opportunity to suppliers for better understanding their customer base and designing more effective tariff structures. In the past, various clustering methods have been proposed for meaningful customer partitioning. This paper presents a novel finite mixture modeling framework based on C-vine copulas (CVMM) for carrying out consumer categorization. The superiority of the proposed framework lies in the great flexibility of pair copulas toward identifying multidimensional dependency structures present in load profiling data. CVMM is compared to other classical methods by using real demand measurements recorded across 2613 households in a London smart-metering trial. The superior performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by analyzing four validity indicators. In addition, a decision tree classification module for partitioning new consumers is developed and the improved predictive performance of CVMM compared to existing methods is highlighted. Further case studies are carried out based on different loading conditions and different sets of large numbers of households to demonstrate the advantages and to test the scalability of the proposed method.

Finding the most appropriate sizing requires a thorough understanding of energy demand. However, empirical data necessary to support such an understanding is scarce, and district energy systems are typically oversized. This study uses smart meter data from the largest field trial to analyse residential energy consumption in the UK. It presents graphically the seasonal and daily variations in energy consumption patterns, the weather dependence of energy loads, and peak hourly demand during particularly cold weather conditions. It also explores the diversity effect in residential energy consumption and computes the after diversity maximum demand at different levels of aggregations. Results show that, peak hourly gas consumption was nearly seven times higher than electricity consumption during the cold spells, while diversity reduced gas and electricity maximum demand per dwelling up to 33% and 47%, respectively. This empirical quantitative analysis of energy demand and diversity can support improved design and operation of district energy, and in particular, enable reduced capital and running costs, and an improved understanding of economies of scale for district heating networks.

The wealth of smart meter data stored by most modern utilities provides an important resource, however sub-metering of specific end-uses is still fairly limited. This makes it more difficult to assess the impact of new or different customer energy uses on aggregate demand curves. This paper presents a regression model to predict the impact of weather on aggregate sectoral electricity demand. The model enables disaggregation into three specific demand categories: base demand, heating demand and cooling demand. To improve the accuracy of predictions, the model uses temperature data at multiple temporal resolutions, varying changepoint temperatures where customers are assumed to switch between heating and cooling, and Probit analysis to model the use of portable air conditioning units. The models developed for the residential and commercial sectors showed good fits (coefficient of determination of 0.9710 and 0.9790 respectively), however had difficulty modeling the cooling demand. The disaggregation method showed promise when compared to data from another study but requires further validation. Once validated, these models could be applied to assess the impact of climate change and changing technologies on each sector.

In the residential sector smart metering allows detailed readings of the power consumption in the form of large volumes time series that encodes relevant information for distribution network operators DNOs to manage in optimal ways low-voltage networks. Further, DNOs may leverage the smart meter data to identify customer group for energy efficiency programs and demand side response DSR (e.g., dynamic pricing schemes). In this paper, we outline the application of smart meter data mining to identify consumers who are more responsible for the peak system using responsibility factor and consumption variability. Identification of consumers having higher responsibility to the peak system may yield to better enhance energy reduction recommendations and enable more tailored dynamic pricing plans depending on the consumer&#8217;s influence on the utility peak. Responsibility factor and consumption variance have been investigated as input features of the clustering algorithms.

A novel method is proposed to detect baseload (i.e., power constantly consumed by some appliances that are never turned off) segments from daily load profiles. Test on ground truth data shows the high accuracy performance of the proposed method and its adaptiveness to the heterogeneity in energy consumptions across customers.

The proposed methodology is applied to a real dataset of Irish households collected by smart meters over one year. For each cluster, the model provides three consumption profiles that depend on the day type. In the first instance, the model is applied on the electricity consumption of users during one month to extract groups of consumers who exhibit similar consumption behaviors. The clustering results are then crossed with contextual variables available for the households to show the close links between electricity consumption and household socio-economic characteristics. At the second instance, the evolution of the consumer behavior from one month to another is assessed through variations of cluster sizes over time.

The calculations were performed using 30-minute generation and consumption data from a large scale smart meter project in Cyprus. To investigate the effects of recent advances in local legislation, an analysis for higher PV capacities (5 kWp and 10 kWp) was also performed. The PV generation profiles for 5 kWp and 10 kWp PVs were obtained by scaling the 3 kWp PV generation profiles. The results showed that the self-consumption of the analyzed households varied seasonally, as it was related to their heating and cooling demand. More interestingly, the ratio between the households' annual electricity generation and demand, formally defined here as generation-to-demand ratio (GTDR), was found to be related to the value ranges of the studied load matching indicators. Hence, on average, households with 3 kWp PV generators annually self-consumed 48.17% and exported 2,415.10 kWh of their PV generation. On the other hand, households with larger PV generators were characterized by a higher GTDR, but lower load matching capabilities. For the cases of 5 kWp and 10 kWp PV generators, the average self-consumption fell to 34.05% and 19.31%, while the exported PV generation was equal to 5,122.47 kWh, and 12,534.90 kWh, respectively. Along with lower load matching capabilities, households that generated more than they consumed were also found to have a lower potential for CO2 emissions reduction per installed kWp within the boundaries of the building. In this context, the GTDR could be used by stakeholders to characterize buildings, infer possible value ranges of more complex indicators and make evidence based decisions on policy and legislation.

The main goal of the analysis is to automatically extract, in a non-intrusive way, number of socio-economic household properties including family type, age of inhabitants, employment type, house type, and number of bedrooms. The knowledge of specific properties enables energy utilities to develop targeted energy conservation tariffs and to assure balanced operation management. In particular, classification of the households based on the electricity usage delivers value added information to allow accurate demand planning with the goal to enhance the overall efficiency of the network. The approach was evaluated by analyzing smart meter data collected from 4182 households in Ireland over a period of 1.5 years.

In this paper, we investigated a scalable machine learning framework to infer the appliances' ToU from energy load shapes in a collection of residential buildings. A scalable and generalized inference model obviates the need for model training in each building to facilitate its adoption by relying on training data from a set of previously observed buildings with available appliance-level data. To this end, we demonstrated the feasibility of using load shape segmentation to boost ToU inference in buildings by learning from their nearest matches that share similar energy use patterns. To infer an appliance ToU for a building, classification models are trained for inference on subintervals of load shapes from matched buildings with known ToU. The framework was evaluated using real-world energy data from Pecan Street Dataport. The results for a case study on electric vehicles (EV) and dryers showed promising performance by using 15-min smart meter load shape data with 83% and 71% F-score values, respectively, and without in-situ training.

This cycle of energy-intensive adaptation has so far received little consideration by the broader energy community.

To this end, an ensemble model for electricity theft detection method based on genetic optimization is developed. At first, synthetic samples that have an approximate distribution to that of true samples of electricity theft are prepared through use of a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Afterwards, features of anomalous electricity consumption are extracted with the aid of dimension reduction through principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, an ensemble deep learning network based on AdaBoost is established to mine implicit information in continuous time series data and detect anomalous electricity consumption of labelled users. Moreover, the hyperparameters of the deep neural network are optimized based on a genetic algorithm (GA). By taking data pertaining to the electricity consumption of users collected from smart meters of the State Grid Corporation of China as examples, the results show that our model is superior to other detection methods (such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and traditional artificial neural network (ANN)) in the sensitivity and the area under the curve (AUC).

The limited nature of supervision and control on these networks require novel tools for operation and planning in this environment. In this paper, we propose a methodology for synthesizing stochastic demand and generation profiles for unobserved customers with rooftop PV, called prosumers. The proposed model bridges the gap between the limited available empirical data, and the large amount of high-quality, stochastic demand and generation data required for probabilistic analysis. The approach employs clustering analysis and a Dirichlet-categorical hierarchical model of the features of unobserved prosumers. Based on the data of clusters of prosumers, Markov chain models of demand and generation profiles are constructed from empirical data, and synthetic demand profiles are subsequently sampled from these. The sampled traces are cross-validated and show a good statistical fit to the observed data. Two case studies are considered to confirm the validity of the proposed methodology.

As they pose significant load on the power grid, knowledge on their existence is crucial for grid operators, e.g., to forecast load and to plan grid operation. Further details, like the thermal reservoir (ground or air source) or the age of a heat pump installation renders energy-related services possible that utility companies can offer in the future (e.g., detecting wrongly calibrated installations, household energy efficiency checks). This study investigates the prediction of heat pump installations, their thermal reservoir and age. For this, we obtained a dataset with 397 households in Switzerland, all equipped with smart meters, collected ground truth data on installed heat pumps and enriched this data with weather data and geographical information. Our investigation replicates the state of the art in the area of heat pump detection and goes beyond it, as we obtain three major findings: First, machine learning can detect the existence of heat pumps with an AUC performance metric of 0.82, their heat reservoir with an AUC of 0.86, and their age with an AUC of 0.73. Second, heat pump existence can be better detected using data during the heating period than during summer.

In addition to allowing utility companies to monitor the status of their network independently in autonomous fashion, data collected by smart meters as part of the wider advanced metering infrastructure, can be valuable for third parties, such as government authorities. The availability of the information, the granularity of the data, and the real-time nature of the smart meter, means that predictive analytics can be employed to profile consumers with high accuracy and approximate, for example, the number of individuals living in a house, the type of appliances being used, or the duration of occupancy, to name but a few applications. This paper presents a machine learning model comparison for unemployment prediction of single household occupants, based on features extracted from smart meter electricity readings. A number of nonlinear classifiers are compared, and bench marked against a generalized linear model, and the results presented. To ensure the robustness of the classifiers, we use repeated cross validation. The results revealed that it is possible to predict employability status with Area Under Curve (AUC) = 74%, Sensitivity (SE) = 54% and Specificity (SP) = 83%, using a multilayer perceptron neural network with dropout, closely followed by the results produced by a distance weighted discrimination with polynomial kernel model.

However, the clusters developed exhibit a large variation with resulting shadow clusters, making it impossible to truly identify the individual clusters. Using clearly defined dwelling types, this paper will present methods to improve clustering by harvesting inherent structure from the smart meter data. This paper clusters domestic electricity consumption using smart meter data from the Danish city of Esbjerg. Methods from time series analysis and wavelets are applied to enable the K-Means clustering method to account for autocorrelation in data and thereby improve the clustering performance. The results show the importance of data knowledge and we identify sub-clusters of consumption within the dwelling types and enable K-Means to produce satisfactory clustering by accounting for a temporal component. Furthermore our study shows that careful preprocessing of the data to account for intrinsic structure enables better clustering performance by the K-Means method.

In order to minimize risks from increasing extreme heat, it is critical to (a) project increases in electricity use with urban warming, and (b) identify neighborhoods that are most vulnerable due in part to a lack of air conditioning (AC) and inability to afford increased energy. Here, we utilize smart meter data from 180 476 households in Southern California to quantify increases in residential electricity use per degree warming for each census tract. We also compute AC penetration rates, finding that air conditioners are less prevalent in poorer census tracts.

A generalized additive model approach,"Installing photovoltaic panels (PV) on household rooftops can significantly contribute to mitigating anthropogenic climate change. The mitigation potential will be much higher when households would use PVs in a sustainable way, that is, if they match their electricity demand to their PVs electricity production, as to avoid using electricity from the grid. Whilst some have argued that owning PVs motivate households to use their PV in a sustainable way, others have argued that owning a PV does not result in load shifting, or that PV owners may even use more energy when their PV production is low. This paper addresses this critical issue, by examining to what extent PV owners are likely to shift their electricity demand to reduce the use of electricity from the grid. Extending previous studies, we analyse actual high frequency electricity use from the grid using smart meter data of households with and without PVs. Specifically, we employ generalized additive models to examine whether hourly net electricity use (i.e., the difference between electricity consumed from the grid and supplied back to the grid) of households with PVs is not only lower during times when PV production is high, but also when PV production low, compared to households without PVs. Results indicate that during times when PV production is high, net electricity use of households with PV is negative, suggesting they sent back excess electricity to the power grid. However, we found no difference in net electricity use during times when PV production is low. This suggests that installing PV does not promote sustainable PV use, and that the mitigation potential of PV installment can be enhanced by encouraging sustainable PV use.

The first case of COVID-19 in South Korea was identified on 20 January 2020. The Korean government implemented the first social distancing measures in the first week of March 2020. As a result, energy consumption in the industrial, commercial and educational sectors decreased. On the other hand, residential energy consumption increased as telecommuting work and remote online classes were encouraged. However, the impact of social distancing on residential energy consumption in Korea has not been systematically analyzed. This study attempts to analyze the impact of social distancing implemented as a result of COVID-19 on residential energy consumption with time-varying reproduction numbers of COVID-19. A two-way fixed effect model and demographic characteristics are used to account for the heterogeneity. The changes in household energy consumption by load shape group are also analyzed with the household energy consumption model. There some are key results of COVID-19 impact on household energy consumption. Based on the hourly smart meter data, an average increase of 0.3% in the hourly average energy consumption is caused by a unit increase in the time-varying reproduction number of COVID-19. For each income, mid-income groups show less impact on energy consumption compared to both low-income and high-income groups.

This study provides rigorous empirical evidence of the impacts of three big special environmental events, as a specific form of nudge, on short-run electricity-saving behaviors using high-frequency smart meter data in Shanghai, China, for both residential and commercial consumers. We find that World Environment Day and National Energy Saving Publicity Week caused commercial users to reduce their electricity consumption by 1.35 kWh h-1 and 0.6 kWh h-1 intra-event, around 17% and 8% reduction compared to average consumption, but the impacts decayed rapidly once the events ended. Earth Hour did not lead to significant energy-saving effects for both residential and commercial users.

However, most existing works intend to predict single household characteristic via smart meter data independently, and ignore the joint analysis of different characteristics. In this paper, we consider each characteristic as an independent task and intend to predict multiple household characteristics simultaneously by designing a new multi-task learning formulation: discriminative multi-task relationship learning (DisMTRL). Specifically, two main challenges need to be handled: 1) task relationship, that is the embedded structure of relationships among different characteristics and 2) feature learning, there exist redundant features in original training data. To achieve these, our DisMTRL model aims to obtain a simple but robust weight matrix through capturing the intrinsic relatedness among different characteristics by task covariance matrix (MTRL) and incorporating the discriminative features via feature covariance matrix (Dis). For model optimization, we employ an alternating minimization strategy to learn the optimal weight matrix as well as the relationship between tasks by converting feature learning regularization as trace minimization problem. For evaluation, we adopt a smart meter dataset collected from 4232 households in Ireland at a 30 min granularity over an interval of 1.5 years. The experimental results justify the effectiveness of our proposed model.

By analyzing the electricity consumption behavior of more than 5000 households over an 18-month period and deploying a wide array of machine learning methods, this paper examines whether high-frequency meter data are sufficient to predict the home-occupancy status of households not only in the present but also in the future. The authors believe that this is the first study at such a scale on this issue. The study proposes a genetic programming approach for feature engineering when training the models. The results reveal a high predictive power for smart meter data in establishing the present and future occupancy status of households. Also, the analysis of the demographic data suggests that households known to be least concerned with privacy are the ones who are more vulnerable to smart meter privacy implications.

To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ECD analysis, we proposed an improved K-means algorithm, in which principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensions of smart meter time series data and the initial cluster centers were optimized. 3000 daily electricity consumption profiles (ECPs) of 1000 residents, obtained from the smart metering electricity customer behavior trials of Irish, and 2000 yearly residential ECPs from Jiangsu Province, China, were used in the experiments. The ECPs were divided into 7 and 4 clusters respectively based on their ECPs, and the characteristics of each cluster were extracted. In addition, the changes of residential electricity consumption are also reflected in the shape variation of ECPs. However, traditional similarity measurements cannot find the shape similarity of ECPs. Therefore, a shape-based clustering method was also proposed to group ECPs with similar shapes and the detailed algorithm procedures were provided. The results showed that the shape-based clustering method can effectively find similar shapes and identify typical electricity consumption patterns based on daily ECPs.

In particular, smart meters allow tracking electricity load consumption at a very disaggregated level and at high frequency rates. This data opens the possibility of developing new forecasting models with a potential positive impact on electricity systems. We present a general methodology that can process and forecast many smart-meter time series. Instead of using traditional and univariate approaches, we develop a single but complex recurrent neural-network model with long short-term memory that can capture individual consumption patterns and consumptions from different households. The resulting model can accurately predict future loads (short-term) of individual consumers, even if these were not included in the original training set. This entails a great potential for large-scale applications as once the single network is trained, accurate individual forecast for new consumers can be obtained at almost no computational cost. The proposed model is tested under a large set of numerical experiments by using a real-world dataset with thousands of disaggregated electricity consumption time series. Furthermore, we explore how geo-demographic segmentation of consumers may impact the forecasting accuracy of the model.

We show that this reduction is much smaller than the actual solar electricity generation. We also show that business distributed solar consumers create a further challenge to the utilities by not reducing their monthly maximum demand in July and August. Lastly, we calculate the benefit of reduced air emissions by multiplying the measured hourly reduction in electricity purchased from the grid by the marginal emission factors of CO2, SO2, NOx, and particulate matter.

Smart metering provides considerable opportunities in this respect and allows for the assessment of household characteristics, behaviors and routines that drive household electricity loads. However, the handling of vast quantities of data delivered by smart metering systems requires advanced data analytics technologies and pattern detection algorithms. For the improvement of load forecasting strategies, a good user aggregation and classification is necessary. In the present paper we address this issue and propose a novel technique for data aggregation that was inspired by network science principles. We operate with a dataset of 1 year hourly measured electricity consumption data of 2201 users. The weekly and annual user load profiles are considered separately. Based on the load time series, we construct functional energy consumption networks and extract the minimum spanning tree. Subgroups with similar consumption curves are then objectively identified by means of a community detection algorithm. The proposed methodology is purely data-driven and facilitates an efficient aggregation of users, reduces heterogeneity, eases the study of the relation with environmental factors such as temperature, and is developed to efficiently handle large datasets in an unbiased manner.

The analysis was performed on one year of smart meter electricity demand data from 656 households in Switzerland. We present a rigorous assessment of sample aggregation and clustering approaches for creating representative electricity demand profiles. We propose a clustering method using five features defining the shape of household electricity demand profiles, which demonstrates significantly improved cluster quality relative to using raw profile data. The cluster analysis of average household electricity demand profiles resulted in three distinct clusters, which challenges the assumption made by Swiss energy norms that one standard pattern fits all homes. Furthermore, cluster analysis of daily demand profiles within the household was performed, resulting in four distinct clusters and demonstrating that daily raw profiles for a household significantly differ from the average profile for that household. Averaging the data suppresses the diversity of the electricity use patterns within the individual household. Electricity demand profiles have important implications for policy makers, particularly if time of use tariffs are introduced to match future stochastic renewable energy supply.

Understanding how the level and timing of electricity consumption is related to household characteristics is important in planning production and grid capacities and in designing policies. Linking Danish smart-meter data for 2017 to detailed household characteristics derived from administrative registers, we analyse how the level and profile of hourly electricity consumption is related to these characteristics. In addition, we examine to what extent having a flat rate for electricity implies cross-subsidies between residential customers in Denmark. We find that both the level and timing of consumption vary significantly with household characteristics, mainly the type of dwelling, its heating technology, its use of electric vehicles, and the number and age of the adults and children who live there, all of which affect the level and timing of consumption. Assuming hourly pricing with constant consumption rates, the average price per kWh paid by different categories of household varies only marginally. That is, the flat rate presently seen by Danish households implies limited cross-subsidies between groups of residential customers. Consequently, introducing real-time pricing for Danish residential customers should not pose serious redistribution concerns and would improve economic efficiency.

Given the scale of MV networks, supplying thousands of customers through hundreds of LV transformers, distribution companies will require cost-effective and scalable solutions. This work proposes an adaptive control strategy to manage asset congestion and voltages in both MV and LV networks leveraging existing controllable devices and without network models. For asset congestion, a bottom-up approach is adopted using smart meter data and irradiance to estimate the maximum allowable PV generation. For voltages, the target of the MV on-load tap changer is updated according to smart meter data. The proposed control strategy, which does not require any electrical model information, is assessed on a real large-scale Australian MV-LV network (4,600+ customers, 79 LV transformers) considering realistic, high-resolution, time-series smart meter and generation data. To cater for load and generation uncertainties, a time-series Monte Carlo analysis is applied considering different PV penetrations. It is demonstrated that the proposed electrical model-free control strategy effectively mitigates all voltage and congestions issues across the MV-LV network, making it an attractive scalable alternative to reinforcements.

Further experimental research is needed to identify the determinants for demand response schemes. This paper contributes to addressing this gap by making use of data from a randomised control trial which contains 15 months of smart meter electricity data combined with household characteristics and differences in incentives to shift their electricity use between 11am and 3pm. Cluster analysis performed on electricity data identified three distinct electricity daily load profiles. Each cluster was then linked to household characteristics by means of a multinomial logistic regression to identify the determinants of the load curves' shapes. Findings show that occupancy presence at home, age and appliance ownership were strong predictors. Finally, this paper is among the first to provide experimental evidence on the determinants of load shifting. We find that households with head aged above 65, households who belong to the cluster exhibiting a load profile characterised by a relatively high peak at noon and a low peak in the evening, and those who received money incentives were more likely to shift electricity use towards middle of the day (11am-3pm).

With the increasing integration of DERs in power distribution systems, distributed load control is imperative to smooth the fluctuations that they introduce. However, a main challenge is that distribution systems lack systematic situational awareness because of their limited sensors. Furthermore, most customer-level behind-the-meter (BTM) DERs, such as rooftop photovoltaics (PVs), are being integrated into distribution systems, which complicates the system monitoring and control.

Based on smart energy-meter data from 10,246 households in Singapore, we find strong positive correlations between the progression of the pandemic in the city-state and the residential electricity consumption. In particular, we find that the daily new COVID-19 cases constitute the most dominant influencing factor on the electricity demand in the early stages of the pandemic, before a lockdown. However, this influence wanes once the lockdown is implemented, signifying that residents have settled into their new lifestyles under lockdown. These observations point to a proactive response from Singaporean residents-who increasingly stayed in or performed more activities at home during the evenings, despite there being no government mandates-a finding that surprisingly extends across all demographics. Overall, our study enables policymakers to close the loop by utilizing residential electricity usage as a measure of community response during unprecedented and disruptive events, such as a pandemic.",Singapore,Nation,,11/1/2019,5/31/2020,No,,213,11901,Yes,10246,30-min,Utility Company,EMA,Consumption Behavior (COVID),,,,Understanding Residential Behavior,Understanding Residential Stock and Behaviors,Behavioral change due to Stimuli - COVID,Consumer Behavior,Response to Stimuli - COVID

This study aims to evaluate the economic performance of PV battery systems for end-users. The evaluation takes geological, technological, and socio-economic factors into consideration, thereby making the evaluation more comprehensive. We used PV power generation data and power consumption data of more than 40,000 all-electric houses in Japan. We performed scenario analyses with a sensitivity analysis. The results showed that residential PV battery systems were highly profitable when their storage battery operation modes were appropriately utilized at the end of the purchase period for solar power generation in Japan's feed-in-tariff (FIT) scheme. The profitability, however, varied across regions. The results also indicated that the PV self-consumption rate was more than 50% when charging the battery with surplus power. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggested that the unit prices of grid electricity and the purchasing price of surplus power after the FIT scheme had a significant effect on the profitability of residential PV battery systems.",Japan,Nation,,1/1/2012,12/31/2017,No,,2192,40000,No,,1-hour,Utility Company,Not Specified,Photovoltaics,Battery,Pricing System,,Evaluation of Household Physical Infrastructure,Rate Structures and Policy Evaluation,Time-of-use or real time pricing,Physical Infrastructure,Evaluation of New Technologies

Unfortunately, it is often the case that the only insight into the consumption and generation of energy within a house comes from smart-meter readings. The smart meter records the amount of energy the house takes from the grid, and does not independently measure and report the local generation that might be consumed by the home, or fed back to the grid. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to disaggregate PV generation from energy consumption that also infers installed PV capacity. This is done by disaggregating PV generation from censored smart meter readings, and specifically by finding the most likely distribution for the energy consumption and using it to infer the solar generation. We extend this approach to propose the first technique to infer PV capacity without weather data or a solar proxy, using instead only smart meter readings given a group of houses in close proximity. We evaluate the algorithm on two datasets: (i) the US Pecan Street dataset is adapted so that net energy meter readings are censored; and (ii) a constructed dataset, combining smart meter readings from UK households and solar energy generation from locations across the UK. Our results show comparable accuracy at inferring PV capacity compared to existing approaches, which cannot deal with censored readings which represent over 50% of PV panel installations in the UK.

Analyzing the electric consumption data enables the policymak-ers and building owners to understand consumerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s demand-consumption behaviors. Furthermore, analysis and accurate forecasting of electric consumption are substantial for consumer involvement in time-of-use tariffs, critical peak pricing, and consumer-specific demand response initiatives. Along-side its vast economic and sustainability implications, such as energy wastage and decarbonization of the energy sector, accurate consumption forecasting facilitates power system planning and stable grid operations. Energy consumption forecasting is an active research area; despite the abundance of devised models, electric consumption forecasting in residential buildings remains challenging due to high occupant energy use behavior variability. Hence the search for an appropriate model for accurate electric consumption forecasting is ever continuing. To this aim, this paper presents a spatial and temporal ensemble forecasting model for short-term electric consumption forecasting. The proposed work involves exploring electric consumption profiles at the apartment level through cluster analysis based on the k-means algorithm. The ensemble forecasting model consists of two deep learning models; Long Short-Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). First, the apartment-level historical electric consumption data is clustered. Later the clusters are aggregated based on consumption profiles of consumers. At the building and floor level, the ensemble models are trained using aggregated electric consumption data. The proposed ensemble model forecasts the electric consumption at three spatial scales apartment, building, and floor level for hourly, daily, and weekly forecasting horizon. Furthermore, the impact of spatial-temporal granularity and cluster analysis on the prediction accuracy is analyzed. The dataset used in this study comprises high-resolution electric consumption data acquired through smart meters recorded on an hourly basis over the period of one year. The consumption data belongs to four multifamily residential buildings situated in an urban area of South Korea. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed forecasting model, we compared our model with widely known machine learning models and deep learning variants. The results achieved by our proposed ensemble scheme verify that model has learned the sequential behavior of electric consumption by producing superior performance with the lowest MAPE of 4.182 and 4.54 at building and floor level prediction, respectively. The experimental findings suggest that the model has efficiently captured the dynamic electric consumption characteristics to exploit ensemble model diversities and achieved lower forecasting error. The proposed ensemble forecasting scheme is well suited for predictive modeling and short-term load forecasting. ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2021 by the authors.

Time-of-use tariffs and other methods of time-dependant pricing can be mutually beneficial, realising a cost reduction for both energy companies and customers if the customer responds to the price signalling. However, such tariffs are likely to create positive and negative financial outcomes for individuals because of customer engagement and potential peak shifting capacity. Identifying potential reducers or non-reducers beforehand can optimise a time-of-use programme design, in turn maximising the outcome of the programme. This paper provides a statistical model to identify the characteristics of so-called winners and losers - or households that would be better or worse off under a time-of-use tariff - using only ex ante information. The model's accuracy reaches a reliable level using historical electricity load and basic household characteristics. This accuracy can be further improved if online activity data is available - providing justification for digital interaction and gamification in time-of-use programmes. This paper also publishes a new public dataset of 1423 households in Japan, including historical smart meter data, household characteristics and online activity variables during the time-of-use intervention period in 2017 and 2018.

Reduction of energy consumption became a very important desiderate in the context of the explosive technological development of modern society with a major impact on the future development of mankind. Moreover, due to the large amount of data available from smart meters installed in households. It makes leverage to able to find data abnormalities for better monitoring and forecasting. Detecting data anomalies helps in making a better decision for reducing energy usage wasted. In recent years, machine learning models are widely used for developing intelligent systems. Currently, researchers' main focus is on developing supervised learning models for predicting anomalies. However, there are challenges to train models with unlabeled data indicating data anomaly or not. In this paper, abnormalities are detected in electricity usage using unsupervised learning and evaluated using Excess Mass. The unsupervised anomaly detection model is based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Isolation Forest (iForest). The models are compared with Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and One-class support vector machine (OCSVM). The proposed framework is tested with actual electricity usage and temperature data obtained from Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), which contains normal and anomaly data in time series. Finally, it has been observed that the iForest out-performed as the detection model for the selected use case. The outcome showed that the iForest can quickly detect anomalies in electricity usage data with only a sequence of data without feature extraction. The proposed model is suitable for the Smart Home Energy Management System's practical requirement and can be implemented in various houses independently. The proposed system can also be extended with the various use cases having similar data types. ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2021 The Authors. Published by IASE.

Previous studies focusing on demand-side management have been predominantly restricted to factors that utilities can manage and manipulate, but have ignored factors specific to residential characteristics. They also often presume that households consume similar amounts of energy and electricity. To fill these gaps in literature, the authors investigate two research questions: (RQ1) Does a data mining approach outperform traditional statistical approaches for modelling residential energy consumption? (RQ2) What factors influence household energy consumption? They identify household clusters to explore the underlying factors central to understanding electricity consumption behavior. Different clusters carry specific contextual nuances needed for fully understanding consumption behavior. The findings indicate electricity can be distributed according to the needs of six distinct clusters and that utilities can use analytics to identify load profiles for greater energy efficiency.

This paper takes advantage of the large-scale smart meter data to investigate the electricity consumption inequality and adaptation vulnerability issues. We find that there is a serious inequality underestimation issue arising from annual aggregate data. An average of 8.39% of the inequality is hidden every quarter, while the monthly hidden value reached 13.41% due to the seasonal offset effects. This inequality is the robust nonlinear inverted-N shaped relationship with temperature, which implies that the cold temperatures have a more severe impact on social inequality issues than hot. For cold days, one additional day in the range < 30 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°F would result in an increase of 3.05% electricity consumption inequality. We also find households in high inequality cities have worse response ability when facing extreme temperature, indicating poor will suffer more from extreme temperature exposure.

In this regard, this paper utilizes a data size reduction and clustering methodology to analyze residential consumption behavior. Firstly, the distinctive time periods of household activity during the day are identified. Then, using these time periods, a modified symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) technique is utilized to transform the load patterns into symbolic representations.

However, the energy self-sufficiency of these buildings is surprisingly low. Therefore, the rapid deployment of heat pump based heating systems creates a shift of natural-gas consumption from the previously consumed building side (boilers) towards the electricity production side (power-plants). Fortunately, the development of information and communication technology enables access to consumption/generation data of building-related energy systems. Thus, there is an opportunity to strategically use this data and improve energy self-sufficiency and accommodate heat pump based heating systems. In this study, the improvement of self-sufficiency is discussed using a renovated neighborhood. The presented method incorporates a smart-grid application with a data-driven clustering, prediction, and an energy management strategy. First, clustering of similar demand-profiled dwellings with the k-means algorithm, and demand-prediction using the random-forest technique was performed. Afterwards, electric energy storage was introduced and multi-objective optimization reducing annualized costs and carbon emissions have been performed. For the carbon-dioxide optimal case, when aimed at the entire neighborhood, an annual self-sufficiency increment of more than 25% can be achieved, while four months out of the twelve being 100% energy self-sufficient.

This paper proposes a new top-down modeling approach for residential load profiles (RLPs) based on multivariate elliptical copulas that can capture the complex correlation between time steps. This model can be used to generate individual and aggregated daily RLPs to simulate the operation of medium and low voltage distribution networks in flexible time horizons. Additionally, the proposed model can simulate RLPs conditioned to an annual energy consumption and daily weather profiles such as solar irradiance and temperature. The simulated daily profiles accurately capture the seasonal, weekends, and weekdays power consumption trends. Five databases with actual smart meter measurements at different time resolutions have been used for the model's validation. Results show that the proposed model can successfully replicate statistical properties such as autocorrelation of the time series, and load consumption probability densities for different seasons.

Unfortunately, electric utilities are not aware of the location of all solar prosumers due to unauthorized or unreported installations and lack of separate PV metering in areas with Net Energy Metering policies. Knowledge of the location of solar prosumers can inform circuit protection and voltage regulation settings, and help grid operators improve situational awareness and better plan for daily variations in demand, which are further magnified by generation intermittency. This paper proposes an innovative approach to identify customers with PV power generation using net energy consumption data from smart meters. Methods of dimensionality reduction are evaluated to propose an effective means of reducing the amount of data needed to accurately identify solar prosumers to a single data point and improve the clustering time by a significant factor. The proposed advanced classification approach for solar prosumer identification, based on agglomerative clustering, demonstrates very significant classification accuracy and outperforms k-means and neural network based approaches on real consumption data from a large number of residential customers. As the number of solar prosumers is growing daily, a novel Solar Prosumer Identification-Duration Curve is also proposed to give operators and distribution planners insight into how quickly new solar prosumers can be accurately identified.

However, performing utility-scale segmentation for unobservable customers with only monthly billing information, remains a challenging problem. To address this challenge, we propose a new metric, the coincident monthly peak contribution (CMPC), that quantifies the contribution of individual customers to system peak demand. Furthermore, a novel multi-state machine learning-based segmentation method is developed that estimates CMPC for customers without smart meters (SMs): first, a clustering technique is used to build a databank containing typical daily load patterns in different seasons using the SM data of observable customers. Next, to associate unobservable customers with the discovered typical load profiles, a classification approach is leveraged to compute the likelihood of daily consumption patterns for different unobservable households. In the third stage, a weighted clusterwise regression (WCR) model is utilized to estimate the CMPC of unobservable customers using their monthly billing data and the outcomes of the classification module. The proposed segmentation methodology has been tested and verified using real utility data.

This study aims to examine the change in electricity demand from the power grid for EV owners when they add distributed solar panels to their homes. The impacts of the two technologies combined are different from the sum of two individual impacts because they may not be additive and EV consumers' behaviors may be subject to change. We apply a difference-in-differences model and compare consumers with or without EVs and also EV consumers with and without additional PVs. We use the hourly electricity demand data for 13,190 households in the Phoenix metropolitan area in Arizona. Our results show that EV consumers, without PV panels, use more electricity compared to non-EV consumers, and their average hourly demand is higher by 0.4 kWh. After adding PVs, EV consumers decrease the average hourly demand from the electric grid by 1.1 kWh. The co-adoption of PVs with EVs helps reduce the system peak hour loads. Besides, we also find evidence of behavior changes when EV consumers shift some of their EV charging from night to day so that they are charging their EVs with more cleaner electricity. The annual monetary savings for consumers after adding PVs are estimated to be 930, and the total social savings are estimated to be 925. Given the positive co-adoption effects, a policy implication is that incentives should be provided to promote the co-adoption of PVs with EVs.

The recent adoption of smart meter infrastructures provided new granular data streams, largely unavailable just ten years ago, that can be utilized to better forecast building-level demand. This paper uses Bayesian Structural Time Series for probabilistic load forecasting at the residential building level to capture uncertainties in forecasting. We use sub-hourly electrical submeter data from 120 residential apartments in Singapore that were part of a behavioral intervention study. The proposed model addresses several fundamental limitations through its flexibility to handle univariate and multivariate scenarios, perform feature selection, and include either static or dynamic effects, as well as its inherent applicability for measurement and verification. We highlight the benefits of this process in three main application areas: (1) Probabilistic Load Forecasting for Apartment-Level Hourly Loads; (2) Submeter Load Forecasting and Segmentation; (3) Measurement and Verification for Behavioral Demand Response. Results show the model achieves a similar performance to ARIMA, another popular time series model, when predicting individual apartment loads, and superior performance when predicting aggregate loads. Furthermore, we show that the model robustly captures uncertainties in the forecasts while providing interpretable results, indicating the importance of, for example, temperature data in its predictions. Finally, our estimates for a behavioral demand response program indicate that it achieved energy savings; however, the confidence interval provided by the probabilistic model is wide. Overall, this probabilistic forecasting model accurately measures uncertainties in forecasts and provides interpretable results that can support building managers and policymakers with the goal of reducing energy use.

Developing a smart solution to evaluate and track the efficiency of RACs is essentially useful for residents to make necessary maintenance or replacement decisions. While smart meters are increasingly installed to monitor electricity use, the application of smart meter data to evaluate the RAC efficiency remains inadequate. In this paper, we present a data-driven framework to identify non-inverter window RACs with low energy efficiency by analyzing smart meter data from the university student hall rooms. In this framework, we first applied the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) method to predict a RAC's hourly electricity consumption. Then we measured the effect of outdoor temperature on the XGBoost prediction of hourly RAC electricity consumption using the Shapley Additive Explanation method to interpret the RAC's efficiency. We conjectured that the RAC efficiency is normal if the predicted hourly electricity consumption is significantly correlated with the outdoor temperature. In contrast, the RAC efficiency is low if the outdoor temperature changes have little impact on the predicted electricity consumption. Finally, we applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to separate the RACs into the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“low efficiencyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“normal efficiencyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â categories based on each's pattern of outdoor temperature's impact on electricity consumption. Our cross-validation result showed that the XGBoost model can achieve an average R2 score of 0.50 and an average root mean squared error of 0.20 kWh. We used RAC replacement records to validate our framework of interpreting the RAC's efficiency. On average, RACs having low efficiency consumed 25.69% more electricity per hour. Overall, our data-driven framework can contribute to extending the value of smart meters for RAC efficiency evaluation. Meanwhile, the smart meter data-driven framework can be improved, and more validation is needed in the future.

Emerging smart grid technologies pose new challenges and opportunities. Although load forecasting at the aggregate level has been extensively studied, electrical load forecasting at fine-grained geographical scales of households is more challenging. Among existing approaches, semi-parametric generalized additive models (GAM) have been increasingly popular due to their accuracy, flexibility, and interpretability. Their applicability is justified when forecasting is addressed at higher levels of aggregation, since the aggregated load pattern contains relatively smooth additive components. High resolution data are highly volatile, forecasting the average load using GAM models with smooth components does not provide meaningful information about the future demand. Instead, we need to incorporate irregular and volatile effects to enhance the forecast accuracy. We focus on the analysis of such hybrid additive models applied on smart meters data and show that it leads to improvement of the forecasting performances of classical additive models at low aggregation levels.

According to the Paris Agreement, a 50 % reduction in global CO2 emissions is required to ensure the global average temperature does not surpass 2 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C above pre-industrial levels. In this context, 26 % of the overall European energy consumption is used by the residential sector and the global energy consumption is estimated to increase by 1.3 % on average per year until 2050. In the last decade, the development and implementation of smart grid technologies have grown to efficiently and cost-effectively meet the electricity demands of the grid and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. We present a data-driven, enveloped sum of Gaussians-based model and residential household synthesiser that statistically models the household's electricity usage demand based on smart meter data and generates synthetic data that accurately represents the actual demand profile, load peaks, and daily variances for an individual or aggregate group of households.

However, to enable efficient policy interventions, we need to be able to appropriately segment the population of users. The aim of this paper is to consider challenges and opportunities associated with large highly-granular temporal datasets that describe residential electricity consumption. In particular, the focus is on experiments relating to aggregation of smart meter time-series data in the context of clustering and prediction tasks that are often used for customer targeting and to gain insight on energy-use about sub populations.

Our model circumvents the inherent difficulty of unsupervised signal disaggregation by using both the shape of a power spike and its temporal pattern to identify the contribution of CWH reliably. Indeed, many CHWs in France are configured to turn on automatically during off-peak hours only, and we are able to use this domain knowledge to aid peak identification despite the low sampling frequency. In order to test our model, we equipped a home with sensors to record the ground truth consumption of a water heater. We then apply the model to a larger dataset of energy consumption of Hello Watt users consisting of one month of consumption data for 5 k homes at 30-min resolution. In this dataset we successfully identified CWHs in 66.5% of cases where consumers declared using them. Inability of our model to identify CWHs in the consumption signal in the remaining cases is likely due to possible misconfiguration of CWHs, since triggering them during off-peak hours requires specific wiring in the electrical panel of the house. Our model, despite its simplicity, offers promising applications: detection of mis-configured CWHs on off-peak contracts and slow performance degradation.

In addition, adding battery storage reduces electricity needed from the grid during system peak hours, helping utilities better flatten the load curves.

The availability of fine-grained energy consumption information from the smart meter empowers the energy policy-makers to design realistic DSM and NM plans with a detailed analysis of usage patterns, dynamics, and characteristics. This paper presents a novel cluster-specific analysis framework to examine trends in residential electricity consumption to understand their potential for participating in energy efficiency, demand response, and net metering programs. In this process, the proposed framework utilises the Hierarchical clustering on energy usage patterns of residential consumers of Kolkata, India to obtain the representative profiles. Further, six different load shape characteristics are proposed to semantically analyse the clustered profiles for understanding the underlying diversity in consumption behaviour. Moreover, a novel statistical approach is incorporated into the proposed framework to evaluate the electricity consumption of every customer based on the number of peaks in a day, solar size required, and consumption during solar generation hours. The findings emphasise the critical nature of examining consumption habits in order to execute rational and productive decisions for the residential sector The scalability experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The cluster-specific analysis thus recommends power utilities in categorising the groups to participate in the demand-side management, net metering, and hybrid programs based on their respective potential.

On top of this, the end of the Feed-in-Tariff programme has significantly increased interest in combined PV + BES systems. In this paper, we explore the economics of domestic PV + BES systems, extending the current literature on the topic via the use of a large smart meter dataset and a demographic comparison. Predictably, time-varying tariffs and higher electricity prices generally strengthen the economic arguments for PV + BES systems, however our consumption data yields a wide range of Net Present Values for different consumers. In terms of demographics, we find that batteries are more favourable for more affluent households due to their larger consumption levels, though profitability becomes more uniform if the batteries are tailored to individual households. This is an important point for policy, since it indicates that if PV + BES systems become widely profitable this is unlikely to help the financial situation of lower-income households.

Appliance shifting techniques have proved to be an effective demand response strategy in load reduction. The purpose of this paper is therefore to help consumers of electricity understand when and how they can shift some appliances from peak to off-peak and vice versa. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses an analysis technique of Richardson et al. (2010). In their survey on time-of-use surveys to determine the usage of electricity in households as far as appliance shifting was concerned, this study allowed for the assessment of how the occupantsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ daily activities in households affect residential electricity consumption. Fell et al. (2014) modeled an aggregate of electricity demand using different appliances (n) in the household. The data for the peak time used in this study were identified from 05:00 to 08:00 and 17:00 to 21:00 for testing the load shifting algorithms, and the off-peak times were pecked from 10:00 to 16:00 and 23:00. This study technique used load management considering real-time scheduling for peak levels in the selected homes. The household devices are modeled in terms of controlled parameters. Using this studyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s time-triggered loads on refrigerators and air conditioning systems, the findings suggested that peak loads can be reduced to 45% as a means of maintaining the simultaneous quality of service. To minimize peak loads to around 35% or more, Chaiwongsa and Wongwises (2020) have indicated that room air conditioning and refrigerator loads are simpler to move compared to other household appliances such as cooking appliances. Yet in conclusion, this study made a strong case that a decrease in household peak demand for electricity is primarily contingent on improvements in human behavior. Findings: This study has shown that appliance load shifting is a very good way of reducing electrical consumption in residential homes. The comparative performance shows a moderate reduction of 1% in load as was found in the work done by Laicaine (2014). The results, however, indicate that load shifting to a large extent can be achieved by consumer behavioral change. The main response to this study is to advise policymakers in Ghana to develop the appropriate demand response and consumer education towards the general reduction in electrical load in domestic households. The difficulty, however, is how to get the attention of consumerÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s on how to start using appliances with less load at peak and also shift some appliances from off-peak times. By increasing consumer knowledge and participation in demand response, it is possible to achieve more efficiency and flexibility in load reduction. The findings were benchmarked with existing comparison studies but may benefit from the potential production of structured references. However, the findings show that load shifting can only be done by modifying consumer actions. Research limitations/implications: It should be remembered that this study showed that the use of appliances shifting in residential homes results in load reduction benefits for customers, expressed as savings in electricity prices. The next step will be to build on this cost/benefit study to explain and measure how these reductions transform into net consumer gains for all Ghanaian households. Practical/implications: Load shifting will include load controllers in the future, which would automatically handle electricity consumption from various appliances in the home. Based on the device and user needs, the controllers can prioritize loads and appliance usage. The algorithms that underpin automatic load controllers will include knowledge about the behaviors of groups of end users. The results on the time dependency of activities may theoretically inform the algorithms of automatic demand controllers. Originality/value: This paper addresses an important need for the country in the midst of finding solutions to an unending energy crisis. This paper presents demand response to the Ghanaian electricity consumer as a means to help in the reduction of load in residential homes. This is a novel research as no one has at yet carried out any research in this direction in Ghana. This paper has some new information to offer in the field of demand in household electricity consumption.

So far, there are many studies for compression and clustering based on daily load profiles. However, in order to account for long-term characteristics of electricity load, utilizing yearly load profiles (YLPs) is vital for customer load clustering and analysis. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based YLP feature extraction that jointly captures daily and seasonal variations. By leveraging convolutional autoencoder (CAE), YLPs in 8,640-dimensional space are compressed to 100-dimensional vectors. We apply the proposed CAE framework to YLPs of 1,405 residential customers and verify that the proposed CAE outperforms other dimensionality reduction methods in terms of reconstruction errors, e.g., by 19-40%, or the compression ratio is increased by 130% or higher than other methods for the same reconstruction error. In addition, clustering analysis is performed on the encoded YLPs. Our results confirm that year-round characteristics are well captured during the clustering process and also clearly visualized with load images.

Different from the classic Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), DDTW works on the derivative of the raw data to avoid DTW's problem of pathological alignments. To reduce the computational cost, a fast DDTW (FDDTW) is proposed to speed up the DDTW calculation. Based on the generated bilevel LSD, analytic approaches are proposed to extract features from the data indexed by the LSD to reveal useful information of customers' electricity consumption behaviors.

Accordingly, research efforts have employed data analytics and machine learning methods to segment customers based on their load profiles, which help utilities and energy providers promote customized/personalized targeting for energy programs. Existing energy consumption segmentation techniques use assumptions that could reduce clusters' quality in representing their members. Therefore, in this paper, we investigated a two-stage clustering method for capturing more representative load shape temporal patterns and peak demands through a cluster merging approach. In the first stage, load shapes are clustered (using classical clustering algorithms) by allowing a large number of clusters to accurately capture variations in energy use patterns, and cluster centroids are extracted by accounting for limited shape misalignment within the range of Demand Response (DR) timeframes. In the second stage, clusters with similar centroids and power magnitude ranges are merged using Complexity-Invariant Dynamic Time Warping. We used three datasets consisting of 250 households (15000 profiles) to demonstrate the efficacy of the framework, compared to baseline methods, and discuss the impact on energy management.

Most residential PV systems are installed behind-the-meter (BTM). Due to single meter deployment that measures the net load only, this PV generation is invisible to distribution system operators causing a negative impact on the distribution system planning and local supply and demand balance. This paper proposes a novel data-driven BTM PV generation disaggregation method using only net load and weather data, without relying on other PV proxies and PV panels' physical models. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is employed to build a generation difference fitted model (GDFM) and a consumption difference fitted model (CDFM) derived from weather data. Both difference fitted models are refined by a cross-iteration with mutual output. Finally, considering the photoelectric conversion properties, the disaggregated generation results are acquired by the refined GDFM of changing input. The proposed method has been tested with actual smart meter data of Austin, Texas and proves to increase the disaggregated accuracy as compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

However, the charging randomness and uncertainty of a large number of EVs have brought new challenges to the safe and stable operation of the power grid. The charging disorder of household users is stronger. It is of great significance to monitor and extract the real-time household charging loads, formulate corresponding demand response strategy or energy efficiency management and guide their charging behaviors. Therefore, this paper proposes a non-intrusive charging load extraction method using the low-frequency characteristics of electric vehicle charging loads. Firstly, the low frequency components of smart meters are extracted by the two-stage decomposition technique. On this basis, the event monitoring and dynamic time warping (DTW) are used to estimate the charging intervals and amplitudes. Then, taking the decomposed electric vehicle charging loads and the aggregated smart meter data as the inputs, the CNN-Attention-LSTM neural network algorithm is used for the data training in order to forecast the short-term charging of electric vehicles for the household users.

The information extracted from smart meter data enables utilities to identify the socio-demographic characteristics of electricity consumers and then offer them diversified services. Traditionally, this task is implemented in a centralized manner with the assumption that utilities have access to all the smart meter data. However, smart meter data are measured and owned by different retailers in the retail market who may not be willing to share their data. To this end, a distributed electricity consumer characteristics identification method is proposed based on federated learning, which can preserve the privacy of retailers. Specifically, privacy-perseverance principal component analysis (PCA) is exploited to extract features from smart meter data. On this basis, an artificial neural network is trained in a federated manner with three weighted averaging strategies to bridge between smart meter data and the socio-demographic characteristics of consumers.

For our analysis, we employ a large set of residential load data and simulate how different federated learning models and privacy preserving techniques affect performance and privacy. Our simulations reveal that combining federated learning and privacy preserving techniques can secure both high forecasting accuracy and near-complete privacy.

Although there exists a large body of research on demand response in short- and long-term forecasting, household consumption behaviour studies based on smart metering data has not been discussed as much as the demand load studies, especially limited research focusing the residential consumption in China. The study's novelty lies in its use of unsupervised machine learning tools to explore residential customers' demand patterns and response in a finer picture, which provides a better understanding of household electricity demand profiles in China. We investigate behavioural response in three different contexts: 1) seasonal (using weekly consumption profiles); 2) holidays/festivals; and 3) extreme weather situations. The analysis is based on the smart metering data of 2000 households in Chengdu, China over three years from 2014 to 2016. Workday/weekend profiles indicate that there are two distinct groups of households that appear to be white-collar or relatively affluent families. Demand patterns at the major festivals in China, especially the Spring Festival, reveal various types of lifestyle and households. In terms of extreme weather response, the most striking finding was that in summer, at night-time, over 72% of households doubled (or more) their electricity usage, while consumption changes in winter do not seem to be significant. Our research offers more detailed insight into Chinese residential consumption and provides a practical framework to understand households' behaviour patterns in different settings.

Electricity consumption pattern is a good way to describe electricity consumption behavior, and is basically determined by household characteristics (HCs). Effective mining of important factors in HCs can help to shape residential electricity consumption behaviors. This paper proposes a new mining framework for discovering the association between HCs and residential electricity consumption patterns. At first, HCs are classified into six categories by the theory of planned behavior based factor classification. Then, typical electricity consumption patterns (TECPs) of each individual resident in different periods divided by seasons and weekday are extracted by a proposed piecewise symbolic spatial clustering with noise algorithm which combines symbolic aggregate approximation and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm. Afterward, TECPs are clustered by hierarchical clustering method. To determine the clustering number, six clustering validity indexes are applied to evaluate the clustering results. Finally, a feature-selection-based multifactor analysis method is designed to evaluate 95 factors in HCs impacts on TECPs. Results of the case study using 3117 records including smart meter data and survey data show that most factors of attitudes toward energy category and socio-demographic category are effective factors for predicting TECPs, while the factors in appliance and heating category are non-significant. The proposed mining framework and the findings can provide guidance of shaping grid-friendly electricity consumption behavior.

However, it is often difficult to collect sufficient data to build machine learning models, primarily due to cost, technical barriers, and privacy. Synthetic data generation becomes a feasible solution to address data availability issues, while most existing work generates data without considering the balance between usability and privacy. In this paper, we first propose a data generation model based on the Wasserstein Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (WDCGAN), which is capable of synthesizing fine-grained energy consumption time series and corresponding sociodemographic information. The WDCGAN model can generate realistic data by balancing data usability and privacy level by setting a hyperparameter during training. Next, we take the classification of sociodemographic information as an application example and train four classical classification models with the generated datasets, including CNN, LSTM, SVM, and LightGBM. We evaluate the pro-posed data generator using Irish data, and the results show that the proposed WDCGAN model can generate realistic load profiles with satisfactory similarity in terms of data distribution, patterns, and performance. The classification results validate the usability of the generated data for real-world machine learning applications with privacy guarantee, e.g., most of the differences in classification accuracy and F-1 scores are less than 8% between using real and synthesized data.

Empirical evidence from Ireland,"We explore the links between weather variables and residential electricity consumption using high-resolution smart metering data. While weather factors have been used for grid-level electricity demand estimations, the impact of different weather conditions on individual households has not been fully addressed. The deployment of smart meters enables us to analyse weather effects in different periods of the day using hourly panel datasets, which would previously have been impossible. To conduct the analysis, fixed-effects models are employed on half-hourly electricity consumption data from 3827 Irish household meters. We demonstrate that temperature has robust and relatively flat effects on electricity demand across all periods, whereas rain and sunshine duration show greater potential to affect individual behaviour and daily routines. The models show that the most sensitive periods differ for each weather variable. We also test the responses to weather factors for weekends and workdays. Weather sensitivities vary with the day of the week, which might be caused by different household patterns over the course of the week.

This paper focuses on detecting whether a residence possesses a certain type of appliance based on their electricity consumption and the problem of class imbalance within deep learning model training for large power appliances with the state 'ON'. We propose a data-driven deep learning approach with attention mechanism to detect residential appliances from low-resolution aggregate energy consumption data. Firstly, the historical consumption profile of each user is divided into a specific length and labeled with the status of an appliance to generate training and test samples. Then, a deep convolutional neural network model with attention mechanism is trained, and the trained model is utilized to classify the test samples. Meanwhile, we obtain appliance status in a residence based on classification of multiple samples. Finally, we propose a novel approach of data generation for class imbalance of appliance detection using generative adversarial networks. In order to guarantee the quality, we devise a mechanism of self-validation to ensure generated data approximating real distribution of minor class samples.

In this paper, an Australian case study is presented on how residential battery installations lead to behavioral changes in the way energy is consumed. Furthermore, data-informed recommendations to both distribution network operators and policy-makers are also provided. The data comprises more than 5000 energy consumers with either distributed generation systems such as Photovoltaics (PV) and Energy Storage Systems (ESS), or without. The methodology focuses on the analysis of energy consumption of consumers with PV and ESS energy consumers and compares them against consumers without ESS. In addition, an economic analysis on the benefit of installing ESS is presented using payback period and internal rate of return. The main finding is that residential energy storage systems provide a range of benefits to the distribution network.

For a distribution network with embedded photovoltaic (PV) systems, it is also desirable to enumerate these premises since unreported PV installations can have a detrimental impact on voltage control, frequency regulation, and incur reverse power flows. In this paper, a holistic smart meter data analytics approach is proposed for classifying and characterizing the intra-day load curves of PV and non-PV households. Unlike existing studies based on raw time-series data, a series of interpretable and discriminating global and peak-period features are first developed to extract the physical information of load patterns. A two-step feature-based clustering is then applied to classify the load profiles of PV and non-PV households. A post-clustering quantitative compositional analysis is developed to characterize the energy use variability and compositional changes for each household. The proposed PV household identification method allows network owners to identify the existence of PV installations in a particular area for voltage control and ancillary service provision. In the longer term, effective load pattern categorization and post-clustering characterization can help better understand demand characteristics of different cohorts of customers, network utilization, and network-level changes in load growth.

However, our ability to use this information to generate actionable insights about residential electricity demand remains limited. In this research, we propose and test a new framework for understanding residential electricity demand by using a dynamic energy lifestyles approach that is iterative and highly extensible. To obtain energy lifestyles, we develop a novel approach that applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a method commonly used for inferring the latent topical structure of text data, to extract a series of latent household energy attributes. By doing so, we provide a new perspective on household electricity consumption where each household is characterized by a mixture of energy attributes that form the building blocks for identifying a sparse collection of energy lifestyles. We examine this approach by running experiments on one year of hourly smart meter data from 60,000 households and we extract six energy attributes that describe general daily use patterns. We then use clustering techniques to derive six distinct energy lifestyle profiles from energy attribute proportions. Our lifestyle approach is also flexible to varying time interval lengths, and we test our lifestyle approach seasonally (Autumn, Winter, Spring, and Summer) to track energy lifestyle dynamics within and across households and find that around 73% of households manifest multiple lifestyles across a year.

Most rooftop PV systems are installed behind-the-meter (BTM), i.e., only the net demand is metered, while the native demand and PV generation are not separately recorded. Under this condition, the PV generation and native demand are invisible to utilities, which brings challenges for optimal distribution system operation and expansion. In this paper, we have come up with a novel two-layer approach to disaggregate the unknown PV generation and native demand from the known hourly net demand data recorded by smart meters: 1) At the aggregate level, the proposed approach separates the aggregate PV generation time series from the aggregate net demand time series for customers with PVs. 2) At the customer level, the separated aggregate-level PV generation is allocated to individual PVs. These two layers leverage the spatial correlations of native demand and PV generation, respectively. One primary advantage of our proposed approach is that it is more independent and practical compared to previous works because it does not require PV array parameters, meteorological data and previously recorded solar power exemplars. This paper has verified our proposed approach using real native demand and PV generation data.

Reading a meter once in a month is not enough, instead, it requires real-time meter reading. Smart electricity meter (SEM) is capable of providing a quick and exact meter reading in real-time at regular time intervals. SEM generates a considerable amount of household electricity consumption data in an incremental manner. However, such data has embedded load patterns and hidden information to extract and learn consumer behavior. The extracted load patterns from data clustering should be updated because consumer behaviors may be changed over time. The purpose of this study is to update the new clustering results based on the old data rather than to re-cluster all of the data from scratch. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes an incremental clustering with nearness factor (ICNF) algorithm to update load patterns without overall daily load curve clustering. Findings: Extensive experiments are implemented on real-world SEM data of Irish Social Science Data Archive (Ireland) data set.

Linear mixed effects modelling resulted in adjusted R2 between 63% and 80% depending on sample size and combinations of contextual data used. Increased daily energy consumption was significantly associated (p-value < 0.05, VIF < 5) with: households living in buildings with more rooms and bedrooms, that are older, more detached, have air-conditioning, and experience colder (more heating degree days) or less sunny weather; households with more adult occupants, more children, older adult occupants, higher heating temperature setpoints, and that do not try to save energy. The results demonstrate the value of smart meter data linked with contextual data for improving understanding of energy demand in British housing.

Currently, supervised learning methods are widely adopted to identify household profiles using smart meter data. Such methods could achieve promising performance in the case of sufficient labeled data but show low accuracy if labeled data is insufficient or even unavailable. However, the acquisition of accurately labeled data (usually obtained by survey) is very difficult, costly, and time-consuming in practice due to various reasons such as privacy concerns. To this end, a semi-supervised learning approach is proposed in this paper to address the above issues. Firstly, 78 preliminary features reflecting the household profiles information are extracted from both time and frequency domain. Secondly, feature selection methods are introduced to select more relevant ones as the input of the identification model from the preliminary features. Thirdly, a transductive support vector machine method is adopted to learn the mapping relation between the input features and the output household profile identification results. Case study on an Irish dataset indicates that the proposed approach outperforms supervised learning methods when only limited labeled data is available. Furthermore, the impacts of different feature selection methods (i.e., Filter, Wrapper and Embedding methods) are also investigated, among which the wrapper method performs best, and the identification accuracy improves with the increase of data resolution.

We leverage data from 230 thousand smart meters of residential and commercial consumers in 32 communes of Santiago (the capital city of Chile), which allows us to investigate the evolution of their demands with an hourly temporal resolution. Additionally, we use demand data of large industrial consumers provided by the Chilean system operator to study the impact of the pandemic on different economic sectors. This paper demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated containment measures, have featured a drastically different impact on the various types of consumers in Chile. In particular, we show that the demand of residential consumers has increased throughout the first wave, even when we isolate the effects of the pandemic from those related to weather. Furthermore, we study how these effects change in different communes of Santiago, contrasting our findings with the socio-economic levels of the population. In effect, we find different demand response patterns depending on the socio-economic background of consumers. We also show that commercial demand has significantly declined due to the containment measures implemented and that the hospitality and construction economic sectors have been the most affected in the country.

Forecasting load at a fine granularity such as hourly loads of individual households is challenging due to higher volatility and inherent stochasticity. At the aggregate levels, such as monthly load at a grid, the uncertainties and fluctuations are averaged out; hence predicting load is more straightforward. This paper proposes a method called Forecasting using Matrix Factorization (fmf) for short-term load forecasting (stlf). fmf only utilizes historical data from consumers&#x2019; smart meters to forecast future loads (does not use any non-calendar attributes, consumers&#x2019; demographics or activity patterns information, etc.) and can be applied to any locality. A prominent feature of fmf is that it works at any level of user-specified granularity, both in the temporal (from a single hour to days) and spatial dimensions (a single household to groups of consumers). We empirically evaluate fmf on three benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of load forecasting. The computational complexity of fmf is also substantially less than known methods for stlf such as long short-term memory neural networks, random forest, support vector machines, and regression trees.

To predict the demand expected by the grid, many smart meters are required to collect sufficient data. However, the problem is multi-dimensional and simple power aggregation techniques may fail to capture the relational similarities between the various types of users. Therefore, accurate forecasting of energy demand plays a key role in planning, setting up, and implementing networks for the renewable energy systems, and continuously providing energy to consumers. This is also a key element for planning the requirement for storage devices and their storage capacity. Additionally, errors in hour-to-hour forecasting may cause considerable economic and consumer losses. This paper aims to address the knowledge gap in techniques based on machine learning (ML) for predicting load by using two forecasting methods: Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN); and compares the performance of both methods using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The study is based on daily real load electricity data for 709 individual households were randomly chosen over an 18-month period in Ireland.

Hourly demand data at district or urban level helps stakeholders understand the demand patterns from a granular time scale and provides robust evidence in energy management. However, such type of data is often expensive and time-consuming to collect, process and integrate. Decisions built upon smart meter data have to deal with challenges of privacy and security in the whole process. Incomplete data due to confidentiality concerns or system failure can further increase the difficulty of modeling and optimization. In addition, methods using historical data to make predictions can largely vary depending on data quality, local building environment, and dynamic factors. Considering these challenges, this paper proposes a statistical method to generate hourly electricity demand data for large-scale single-family buildings by decomposing time series data and recombining them into synthetics. The proposed method used public data to capture seasonality and the distribution of residuals that fulfill statistical characteristics. A reference building was used to provide empirical parameter settings and validations for the studied buildings. An illustrative case in a city of Sweden using only annual total demand was presented for deploying the proposed method. The results showed that the proposed method can mimic reality well and represent a high level of similarity to the real data.

High-frequency load profiles are decomposed into a low-frequency base load and high-frequency variability at the daily level through a discrete wavelet transformation. Components from different households are subsequently rescaled, shifted and recombined in a stochastic load profile generator to obtain new daily load profiles with high-fidelity behavior. The performance of this generator is evaluated through benchmarking, resulting in a mean average error of 0.09 kW on an average value of less than 3 kW for the daily peaks, whilst preserving their seasonality. The introduced load profile generator is validated as an alternative to privacy-sensitive residential smart meter data in a hosting capacity case study. The analysis focuses on the voltage drop caused by residential electric vehicle charging, considering both real and synthetic data.

During operation, voltage calculations can help determining settings, such as PV curtailment, that ensure compliance with statutory limits. In planning, voltage calculations can help assessing the effects of new connection requests. However, the main challenge for distribution companies is that voltage calculations require power flow analyses (or similar) that need accurate electrical models which, for LV networks, are not readily available for most companies. This paper proposes a scalable electrical model-free voltage calculation methodology that uses Neural Networks to capture the underlying relationships among historical smart meter data (P, Q, and V ) and the corresponding LV network. The methodology is demonstrated using half-hourly data from one realistic LV network (146 customers) from Victoria, Australia, over three weeks and with 20% PV penetration. To account for upstream voltage fluctuations, an integrated MV-LV network with 3,400+ customers is considered. Results considering different weeks with the same and higher PV penetrations demonstrate an average error of less than 2 Volts; showing that, in the absence of LV electrical models, the methodology could be used by distribution companies for different applications.

As a key component of the distribution grid monitoring systems, smart meters installed at each customer's household offer a non-intrusive approach to predict the household characteristics. The resolution of energy consumption data has a great impact on prediction accuracy as fine granularity data can better characterize the household energy usage profile features. However, collecting high-resolution energy consumption data may not be feasible for power utilities due to the substantial cost of upgrading the existing Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). This paper aims to propose a cost-effective framework for the accurate prediction of household characteristics by realizing the multifractal characteristics of residential electric energy consumption data recorded from smart meters. First, Multiscale Multivariate Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MMV-MFDFA) is performed on the energy consumption data to analyze the multiscale relationships of the residential energy usage profile and reveal the multifractal structures embedded in the energy data. Then, Self-Adaptive Multifractal Interpolation (SAMI) is developed to reconstruct quasi high-resolution energy consumption data from which distinctive features relevant to household characteristics are extracted by Mathematical Morphological Decomposition (MMD). Such features are further integrated with an advanced deep learning algorithm - Deep Forest (DF) for household characteristic prediction.

It counters many of the problems presented by renewable energy sources such as variability in production through techniques like load forecasting and dynamic pricing. Smart grid generates massive amounts of data through smart meters, this data is used to forecast future load to adjust distribution. To process all this data, big data analysis is necessary. Most existing schemes use Apache Hadoop for big data processing and various techniques for load forecasting that include methods based on statistical theory, machine learning and deep learning. This paper proposes using Apache Spark for big data analysis and a modified version of the transformer model for forecasting load profiles of households. The modified transformer model has been tested against several state-of-the-art machine learning models. The proposed scheme was tested against several baseline and state-of-the-art machine learning models and evaluated in terms of the RMSE, MAE, MedAE and R2 scores. The obtained results show that the proposed model has better performance in terms of RMSE and R2 which are the preferred metrics when evaluating a regression model on data with a large number of outliers.

This will be particularly disastrous if the grid is unprepared for the climate-induced shifts in electricity demand that will result from increased temperatures. Recently, the use of data-driven modeling has emerged as a way to predict these climate-induced changes in electricity demand, however, much of the work has focused on entire sectors or regions. Here, we focus on the impact of climatic variables on hourly household electricity use for air conditioning. Our goal was to determine the best model for predicting the air conditioning use based on climate variables, as well as use that model to extract insights related to the household-level climate-electricity nexus. Using smart meter data from three US cities (Austin, Texas, Ithaca, New York, and San Diego, California), we tested seven different models of varying complexity. Ultimately, Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) was selected as the best model across all three cities (NRMSE ranged between 0.085 and 0.250). Additionally, we found that while the majority of the climate variables were important, relative humidity was the most important variable in each city. Given that air conditioning tends to drive non-base electricity demand in the summer, understanding these nuances in the climate-electricity nexus as it applies to air conditioning is critical for building a resilient grid.

Obtaining such information through surveys is costly and time-consuming in practice. This paper proposes a novel estimation method for household characteristics with uncertainties using the residential electricity consumption data. To alleviate the class imbalance problem in the dataset, a dynamic time warping sampling (DTWS) method is proposed to generate synthetic data for the minority class. To overcome the problem that the existing methods for identifying household characteristics cannot provide the confidence level of the results, a Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) model is developed for feature extraction and characteristic identification with uncertainties. These quantified uncertainties can be regarded as a measure of confidence and can be used to target customers more effectively for energy efficiency and demand response programs.

The methodology requires data from fiscal smart meters, which makes it applicable to real scenarios where personal data gathering is not feasible. These data are rarely complete; therefore, a robust combination of machine-learning techniques is used to handle missing data and outliers. The novelty of this method relies on identifying and predicting user electricity consumption behaviour as a procedure to improve the forecasting of the overall electricity consumption of each individual customer. The methodology uses Gaussian mixture clustering to identify behaviour clusters and an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classification (XGBoost) model to predict the day-ahead behaviour pattern. This predicted user behaviour cluster is fed into an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to enable an improved capturing of the highly unpredictable user conduct for the forecast of electricity consumption. A novel metric, namely the Euclidean Distance-based Accuracy (EDA), is finally proposed to enable a more thorough evaluation of time series classification algorithms. The whole development is tested over 500 residential users placed in a southeastern region of Spain. The results showed that, when the novel approach was used, the MAPEd and NRMSEd were reduced by 7% and 9% respectively, increasing to a 20% and 17% respective reduction for the best cases according to EDA. This methodology sets the basis for massive user-centred analyses, very profitable to any electricity company.

The residential sector was impacted the most due to an increase in the average occupancy during the lockdown period. This increment continued even after the lockdown due to the fear of infection. The COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown measures can be considered experimental setups, allowing for a better understanding of how users shift their consumption under new conditions. The emergency health measures and new social dynamics shaped the residential sectorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s energy behavior and its increase in electricity consumption. This article presents and analyzes the identified issues concerning residential electricity consumers and how their behaviors change based on the electricity consumption data during the COVID-19 period. The Dubai Electricity and Water Authority conducted a voluntary survey to define the profiles of its residential customers. A sample of 439 consumers participated in this survey and four years of smart meter records. The analysis focused on understanding behavioral changes in consumers during the COVID-19 period. At this time, the dwellings were occupied for longer than usual, increasing their domestic energy consumption and altering the daily peak hours for the comparable period before, during, and after the lockdown. This work addressed COVID-19 and the lockdown as an atypical case. The authors used a machine learning model and the consumption data for 2018 to predict the consumption for each year afterward, observing the COVID-19 years (2020 and 2021), and compared them with the so-called typical 2019 predictions. Four years of fifteen-minute resolution data and the detailed profiles of the customers led to a better understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 on residential energy use, irrespective of changes caused by seasonal variations. The findings include the reasons for the changes in consumption and the effects of the pandemic. There was a 12% increase in the annual consumption for the sample residents considered in 2020 (the COVID-19-affected year) as compared to 2019, and the total consumption remained similar with only a 0.2% decrease in 2021. The article also reports that machine learning models created in only one year, 2018, performed better by 10% in prediction compared with the deep learning models due to the limited training data available. The article implies the need for exploring approaches/features that could model the previously unseen COVID-19-like scenarios to improve the performance in case of such an event in the future.

Therefore, understanding residential customer power demand behaviors is essential for accurate load profiling. However, the large volume of fine-grained smart meter data and the wide variety of residential behavior make load profile extraction extremely challenging, even further exacerbated by deterministic clustering&#x2019;s inherent limitations. This paper develops a distributed auto-clustering approach (DAA) for load profiling using real smart meter data based on a divide-and-conquer scheme to tackle current load profiling challenges. To improve the load profiling accuracy, temperature-based categories (TBCs) are proposed to distinguish days with similar temperatures. A Heterogeneous Distributed Local Sites (HDLS) scheme is developed based on the raster map concept to distribute smart meter data among local sites while considering their size and density. Local sites send the load representatives to a central site for global clustering to significantly reduce clustering complexity and computational burden.

However, consumer social learning (SL) helps frequently adjust electricity plans as social media evolves, preventing REPs from accurately understanding consumer electricity demand. Therefore, this paper constructs a dynamic game model of the retail electricity market considering social learning. REPs announce price and electricity package information to consumers based on market information and historical experience, and consumers first shared electricity usage plans based on their willingness to learn and share information among themselves, and then respond to REPs based on current information and experience. The main findings of this paper are as follows: (i) social learning increases consumer utility, promotes competition, depresses REPs prices, shrinks price differentials, and induces concessions by REPs, but raises volatility risk. (ii) electricity packages combined with social learning can save electricity consumption and significantly reduce volatility risk. Finally, this paper uses Smart Meter Energy Consumption data in London households to demonstrate the impact of social learning and to provide decision support for REP's electricity sales strategies.

The granulated data helps utilities in designing schemes for audience suitable for demand response management to shift the peak hour demand to off-peak hours. In this paper, a method is proposed for load profile segmentation which can be used by utilities for identifying the characteristics of different users and targeting those whose demand curve can be flattened during peak hours with various demand response management schemes. Firstly, exploratory data analysis is done on the cleaned dataset to find the optimal epoch size, understand the distribution of data in each epoch, and use it for dimensionality reduction. For reducing the clustering computation time, dimensionality reduction is done by around 64% using Principal Component Analysis. The first six principal components are identified as carrying maximum variance using the cumulative variance technique in each epoch. Unsupervised Machine Learning based k-means clustering technique is applied to these principal components. The optimal value of k is evaluated using the WCSS technique where k = 5 and k = 3 for residential and SME users respectively is found. The average silhouette coefficient for residential users is 0.48 and for SME users is 0.51. Hence, well-separated clusters are formed with minimum intra-cluster distance using PCA for dimensionality reduction which is used for load profile segmentation and Post Clustering Analysis.

Private households install more and more photovoltaic systems, battery storage and big consumers like heat pumps. Thus, our vision is to augment these collected smart meter time series of a complete system (e.g., a city, town or complex institutions like airports) with simulatively added previously named components. We, therefore, propose a novel digital twin of such an energy system based solely on a complete set of smart meter data including additional building data. Based on the additional geospatial data, the twin is intended to represent the addition of the abovementioned components as realistically as possible.

Evidence from smart meter data of household electricity consumption,"While high-speed railway (HSR) often brings regional prosperity and a boom in real estate, it is unclear how the housing vacancy rate (HVR) changes after the opening of HSR. We identify the HVR changes in response to HSR operation by employing smart meter data of approximately 10 million households in more than 80 counties in the middle and lower regions of the Yangtze River Basin. We find that HSR opening could reduce the urban HVR by 1.64% and its reducing effect is stronger in district-urban than in county-urban areas. The decreasing effect of HSR operation on urban HVR is more noticeable in areas with better air quality, lower living costs, and more service industries. The opposite effects are observed in rural areas, where the HSR operation has increased the rural HVR by 1.16%. Our findings indicate that the siphoning effect of HSR exists on HVR as the rural population along the HSR is attracted to central cities, and positive HSR promotion strategies contribute to reducing urban HVR. With the development of transportation infrastructure, the difference in HVR due to urban and rural population mobility should be taken into account.

A vital climate adaptation measure is deploying air-conditioning (AC), but AC use can increase household energy costs. We evaluate how a warming climate will affect regional energy equity by tying temperature projections with household temperature response functions derived from smart-meter electricity data in Phoenix, Arizona. We simulate future consumption changes under two climate change scenarios from 2020 to 2070, with and without AC efficiency upgrades. We find that the median elderly and low-income household percentage changes are nearly 5 percentage points higher than their counterparts after controlling for decadal, housing, and cooling infrastructural differences. Improving AC efficiency reduces cooling consumption by up to 70% for vulnerable groups. However, a disproportionate share of racial minorities (Hispanic (21%), Black (18%), Asian (12%)) have energy burdens above 6%, indicating affordability challenges. The energy justice implications of this work suggest that intentional considerations of how technology adoption will affect energy affordability and cooling needs are imperative for households to adapt to a warming climate. Such insights are essential for mitigating risk in vulnerable populations, given that policies often rely on ACs as a primary extreme-heat adaptation strategy.<br/></div> ¬© 2023 The Authors",United States,City,Phoenix,5/1/2015,4/30/2019,No,,1461,5881,No,,1-hour,Utility Company,Salt River Project,Air Conditioning,Consumption Behavior (Temperature/Weather),Energy Equity,,Understanding Residential Behavior,Evaluation of New Technologies,Appliances - Air Conditioning,Consumer Behavior,Response to Stimuli - Temperature/weather

With the increased penetration of renewable-based Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and the EV uptake, distribution grids are highly subject to voltage fluctuations due to back power feed from DERs or significant EV charging demand. Conventionally, Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) have addressed this issue by adjusting the taps of transformers. However, managing the naturally unpredictable renewable generation and the power consumption behaviour of technology owners requires advanced real-time algorithms. In this paper, we apply a real-time control algorithm, based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), to a community BESS in order to reduce voltage fluctuations. The MPC algorithm performs in real-time based on readings from smart meters of households. It predicts the future values of voltages at households based on the current and past readings of smart meters, and calculates the BESS charging or discharging rate such that future voltage deviations are minimised. Simulations on the real-world power consumption data from Victorian residential consumers, in Australia, show that the proposed controller performs significantly better than the fixed charging/discharging BESS schedule in both voltage regulation and BESS degradation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first driving privacy relevant work caused only by residential electricity consumption data. For a residential home with an EV, TIIS derives the relationship between trip numbers in a day and charging-starting time, and the relationship between total driving distance and total charging energy. To derive the EV trip information of a residential home, TIIS first extracts an EV charging profile from its electricity consumption data and identifies EV model type and trip numbers as well as total driving distance based on EV charging profiles. Then, TIIS infers EV trip information based on the identified information. We used electricity consumption data and EV driving data to evaluate inference performance of TIIS. The experimental results demonstrate TIIS has as high as 81% trip inference accuracy and works on residential homes with different EV model types.

The BAT is applied to more than 35,000 smart-meter customer load profiles to assess the trade-offs associated with proposed rate designs.

In addition, the need for consumer demand management and services is likely to increase further as distributed resources are activated. Load forecasting technology is essential for customer demand management. Forecasting technology using deep learning has been applied extensively in recent years. Deep-learning-based load forecasting requires data for training a forecasting model, and the available data may be limited by the Personal Information Protection Act. Federated learning has emerged as a solution to this problem. However, in federated learning, the global model in the central server is trained by aggregating the local model sent from the client without filtration. This may result in the global model overfitting or failure to converge by aggregating the model that is not trained effectively in the client. In this study, we introduce a modified federated learning algorithm to solve this problem and propose a method to forecast residential loads. The proposed method is analyzed and evaluated experimentally using smart meter data. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method improves forecasting performance and convergence. For the global model, when the number of clients was two, three, four, and five, the forecasting performances were 4.891, 5.228, 5.488, and 5.633, respectively, on a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) basis, showing performance improvements of 28.4%, 10.0%, 16.3%, and 5.8%.

Residential electricity demands have been widely analyzed considering single-family consumers; however, multi-family consumption patterns remain comparatively understudied. The deployment of smart electricity meters enables the identification of single- and multi-family residential electricity consumption patterns at high temporal resolution. Using smart electricity meter data for the greater Chicago area, we compare electricity demand profiles reported by smart meters from single- and multi-family consumers in a large and diverse urban environment to understand residential electricity patterns better. Our study comprehensively analyzes the daily electricity demand profiles of these two types of residential consumers to identify peak electricity consumption times and magnitudes. Results show that the electricity demand of both residential end-users follows similar time of use patterns, and single-family users approximately double the demand of multi-family users on a per household basis. We also present predictive models of the electricity demand with socioeconomic data at the zip code level. Predictive model results show that multiple linear regression models explain up to 62% and 41% of the mean daily electricity (MDE) demand of single- and multi-family users, respectively. The median age of occupants, percent age 65 and older, mean commute time, and percent high school or higher education are statistically significant predictors of the MDE demand of single-family users, with percent high school or higher education having the highest relative importance. Similarly, median building age, percent multi-family, percent female, median age of occupants, and mean commute time are statistically significant predictors of multi-family electricity consumption, with median age of occupants having the highest relative importance. Modeling electricity demand to uncover differences between single- and multi-family residential electricity demands can assist city planners and utility managers to develop tailored demand management strategies.

This paper tackles the dilemma by proposing a personalized federated approach for individual consumer load forecasting. Specifically, a group of consumers first jointly train a federated forecasting model on the shared smart meter data pool, and then each consumer personalizes the federated forecasting model on their own data.

Due to restrictions or recommendations, companies, industries and residents experienced changes in their routines and many people shifted to working from home. This led to alterations in electricity consumption between sectors and changes in daily patterns. Understanding how various properties and features of load patterns in the electricity network were affected is important for forecasting the network's ability to respond to sudden changes and shocks, and helping system operators improve network management and operation. In this study, we quantify the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has led to shifts in the electricity consumption patterns of different sectors in Sweden. The results show that working from home during the pandemic has led to an increase in the residential sector's total consumption and changes in its consumption patterns, whereas there were only slight decreases in the industrial sector and relatively few changes in the public and commercial sectors. We discuss the reasons for these changes, the effects that these changes will have on expected future electricity consumption patterns, as well as the effects on potential demand flexibility in a future where working from home has become the new norm.<br/></div> © 2023",Sweden,City,Stockholm,1/1/2019,12/31/2021,No,,1096,14843,No,,1-hour,Utility Company,Ellevio AB,Consumption Behavior (COVID),,,,Understanding Residential Behavior,Understanding Residential Stock and Behaviors,Behavioral change due to Stimuli - COVID,Consumer Behavior,Response to Stimuli - COVID

This paper proposes a deep semi-supervised method for electricity theft detection in the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) of smart grids.

The method utilizes the ratio profile generated from the readings of the observer meter and the user's smart meter as the input, to reduce false positives, which is then transformed into a 2D image with the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to capture the time- frequency information. Discriminative features are extracted from the CWT image with a deep convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and principal component analysis (PCA), which are fed into a semi-supervised autoencoder for classification. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated and compared with a set of baselines and four supervised machine learning and deep learning methods under 11 different false data injection (FDI) attacks using smart meter data from both business and residential users.

However, privacy concerns often restrict access to large-scale residential smart meter datasets, leaving only synthetic load profiles available to the public, which generally only represent averages of individual data. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes an innovative approach leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic residential load profiles.

DGAN has been selected due to its demonstrated capacity for capturing interday and seasonal dynamics. Second, a wavelet-based decomposition-recombination technique is employed to create stochastic daily profiles with realistic intraday variations and peak demand behavior. Our DGAN-based approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness, as evidenced by evaluation against a real-world dataset through a series of qualitative microbenchmarks.

With survey data collected in early 2023 we investigate how consumption reduction correlated with energysaving actions, household and dwelling characteristics, and indicators of underheating and fuel poverty.

Randomly recruiting customers into time-based pricing may lead to customers' bad experiences and utility companies' economic losses. Focusing on this issue, this paper proposes a new customer selection framework for time-based pricing using the smart meter data. To utilize smart meter data effectively, a novel feature engineering procedure is designed, covering both of statistical characteristics and load patterns. Then, a Bayesian neural network (BNN) based prediction model is developed by integrating the Bayesian theory into neural networks for identifying high-potential customers. Finally, the prediction uncertainty is quantified to help utility companies to identify when to trust the prediction results. Case studies on an actual time-based pricing pilot demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. As for the comprehensive metric F1-score, BNN is in the lead, which is 9.0 % higher than neural network, 6.0 % higher than convolutional neural network (CNN), and 3.3 % higher than long short-term memory (LSTM). In addition, by leveraging the quantified uncertainties, the percentage of low-potential households among selected customers drops by 8.92 %, compared to blindly trusting the prediction results. Furthermore, it's found that load pattern features contribute more to model performance than statistical features, revealing that it's the shape, rather than the amplitude, of daily load curves that determines residential price responsiveness.

It draws on a sample of 13,000 homes from Great Britain, applying k -means cluster analysis to smart meter data on their electricity and gas demand over a three-year period from September 2019 to August 2022. Eight typical demand archetypes are identified from the data, varying in terms of the shape of their demand profile over the course of the day. These include an `All daytime' archetype, where demand rises in the morning and remains high until the evening. Several other archetypes vary in terms of the presence and timing of morning and/or evening peaks. In the case of electricity demand, a `Midday trough' archetype is notable for its negative midday demand and high overnight demand, likely a combination of the effects of rooftop solar panels exporting to the grid during the day and overnight charging of electric vehicles or electric storage heating. The prevalence of each archetype across the sample varies substantially in relation to different temporally -varying factors. Fluctuations in their prevalence on weekends can be identified, as can Christmas Day. Among homes with gas central heating, the prevalence of gas archetypes strongly relates to external temperature, with around half of homes fitting the `All daytime' archetype at temperatures below 0 degrees C, and few fitting it above 14 degrees C.

Our analysis characterizes the daily hourly load profiles of approximately 160,000 residential electricity customers across the Southern California Edison (SCE) service area during the period spanning 2015 to 2016 and 2018 to 2019 across weekends, weekdays, seasons, and climate zones. We find that total daily electricity usage was highest in the hottest months of the year compared to milder months, particularly for households located in the hottest climate zones. The most energy-consumptive hours occurred during the mid-afternoon during the hottest months, in contrast to early evening high consumption in cooler months. We find that customers with average daily consumption at or above the 80th percentile cumulatively consume over 40% of electricity during the hottest months of the year residential load, while the bottom half of customers cumulatively consume <25% of the total residential load. The disparities in electricity usage across SCE households are higher in the mid-day, especially in milder months across all regions, and in mild climate zones compared to hotter climate zones since loads are not as dependent on high HVAC loads.<br/></div> © 2024",United States,Region,the Greater Los Angeles area,,,Yes,4 years,1461,163403,No,,1-hour,Utility Company,SCE,Consumption Behavior (Temperature/Weather),Consumption Behavior (Geographical Characteristics),,,Understanding Residential Behavior,Understanding Residential Stock and Behaviors,Load patterns - Meteorology,Consumer Behavior,Load patterns - Meteorology

The response inertia is mainly affected by the household electricity consumption scale. The inertia of large electricity users is four times that of small users.

This methodology uses consumption data available from smart meter installed at consumers' premises only without requiring any central observer meter. Previous research using control charts for theft detection assumed anomaly free historical power consumption data, impacting parameter estimation accuracy in real world datasets. To address this, two robust techniques have been used to estimate mean and standard deviation of consumption data, enhancing resistance of EWMA chart to anomalies. Additionally, the methodology incorporates the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for selecting control chart design parameters, ensuring the optimal combination of decision metrics across all theft levels.

Despite their growing diffusion, fed by the large-scale smart meter roll-out currently ongoing in many energy systems, rigorous studies providing evidence on their effects are still missing, especially for the long-term. We address this research gap by analysing a one-year long app-based electricity saving intervention performed in Switzerland between 2018 and 2019, involving 55 self-selected households. Adopting a quasi-experimental approach and considering four full years of energy consumption data, we estimate the app's average treatment effect over time and perform heterogeneity analyses on household sub-groups, on varying their characteristics and intensity of app use. The app reduced consumption and CO2 emissions during the intervention (average treatment effect on the treated equal to 4.95%, statistically significant at the 0.05 level; Cohen's d effect size equal to 0.35). However, one year later the effect disappeared. Our results put policies based on persuasive app use into perspective: taken in isolation, persuasive apps may exhibit limitations regarding long-lasting effects.

This valuable information can help them provide personalized offers and recommendations to help customers towards the energy transition. Appliance detection can be cast as a time series classification problem. However, the large amount of data combined with the long and variable length of the consumption series pose challenges when training a classifier.

Despite its virtue, standard FL is still vulnerable to an intractable cyber threat known as Byzantine attack carried out by faulty and/or malicious clients. Therefore, to improve the robustness of federated short-term load forecasting against Byzantine threats, we develop a state-of-the-art differentially private secured FL-based framework that ensures the privacy of the individual smart meter's data while protect the security of FL models and architecture. Our proposed framework leverages the idea of gradient quantization through the Sign Stochastic Gradient Descent (SignSGD) algorithm, where the clients only transmit the 'sign' of the gradient to the control centre after local model training.

Machine learning has become a popular tool for forecasting residential electricity demand, but previous studies have been limited by lack of access to high spatiotemporal resolution at a regional scale, which reduces a model's ability to capture the relationship between electricity and its driving factors. In this study, we develop and execute a machine learning framework to predict residential electricity demand at varying temporal and spatial resolutions using hourly smart meter electricity records from roughly 58,000 homes provided by Southern California Edison as well as local weather data, building characteristics, and socioeconomic indicators. The best performing model at the household level, multilayer perceptron (MLP), was able to predict electricity demand most accurately at a monthly resolution, achieving an r2 of 0.45, while the most accurate annual and daily models (also MLP) had r2 values of 0.34 and 0.38, respectively.

Hence, this article first analyzes the underlying correlation between water and electricity (W&E) usage collected by the smart meter. This analysis then lends the theoretical basis to propose a new ETD method by comprehensively using the multisource information. More precisely, the proposed method utilizes the mutual information coefficient (MIC) to construct a correlation model between W&E usage and in turn the wavelet clustering algorithm to cluster the MIC of the power distribution users. Thereafter, the resulting weak correlations indicate the suspected users as the electricity theft UZEU in case of zero electricity usage.

The massive penetration of distributed renewable energy, especially small-scale solar photovoltaic (PV), in the residential sector urgently requires us to move from traditional load forecasting to net load forecasting. In recent years, deep learning techniques that can improve model forecasting performance have developed rapidly in the field of residential load forecasting. However, the opaque nature of deep learning makes its practical application very difficult. This paper proposes a Transformer-based probabilistic residential net load forecasting method that utilizes quantile regression to quantify uncertainty in future load demand. Meanwhile, to improve the interpretability of deep learning model, local variable selection network is developed to automatically select relevant features and provide feature-level explanations. Additionally, interpretable sparse self-attention mechanism is proposed to extract long-term temporal dependencies. Numerical experiments are carried out with data from real household smart meters. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art forecasting models. In terms of point forecasting, compared with the most common deep time series forecasting model LSTM, the proposed model decreases by 21.3%, 27.3% and 20.9% On three point forecasting performance metrics. Compared with Vanilla Transformer, the proposed InterFormer decreases by 9.9%, 10.5% and 9.0% On three point forecasting performance metrics.

Tuning the deep learning models‚Äô hyperparameters shows significant improvements in the accuracy, as well as training, and testing times. In addition, a hybrid ensemble strategy that contains bagging, random Subspace, and boosting (BRSB) with ensemble pruning is adapted in the optimised deep learning-based models to extract deep features from multivariate data. In this context, the bidirectional long-short-term memory optimised by the AWDO algorithm (Bi-LSTM-AWDO) based hybrid ensemble learning forecasting model is compared exhaustively with several benchmark models, including the recently developed models in the state-of-the-art.
